I feel like I have two sides to me one evil and one pure and there's no in between and every time I do something it's either coming from a highly positive state of mind or highly negative and it's so difficult to find a balance and control my actions when Im in a negative headspace.

But it gets confused because this other voice says that his tired and he wants to find his wife to end this because she will not stop. \n\nI even dreamed making sexual relations with this woman as I'm intersexual geez it gets tiring.\n\nI'm a lesbian, and my masculine energy is so intense and I have problems with my gender identity. \n\nMaybe I mixing everything up don't know, and this may feel like crazy at least I'm feeling, like I lost my sanity.\n\nAny advice here to seek spiritual help.\nPS: I come from a religious family but I think somehow those dark entities are infiltrated in the religion no one helps like they know that they can't mess up in this problem.",

Therefore, after success, happiness disappears. It seems to appear as pleasure but soon is gone. The truth is success doesn't create happiness. But happiness by itself is success. We have to overcome the myth that we believe in, that if we are successful, we will be happy. In fact, it is the other way around \u2014 if we are happy, we will be successful. After we are successful, are we content, are we satisfied? No. Our need becomes our greed. Our desires and passions overtake us and there is stress and anxiety. So, we are never happy.",

Your a covert pervert, the most i\u2019ll ever say to another dude is.. i think she\u2019s gorgeous or cute wich i guess is weird too but I just wanted to say it for some reason. I\u2019ll never sit around and talk about a female like that, i know he likes her because I can see the jealousy in his face whenever she\u2019s next to me and he\u2019s always trying to joke and talk to her, if only she knew that he thinks of her more as a f**k toy than a human being. This is a reason why I don\u2019t want to be friends with people specifically dudes, my coworkers seem offended that i never accept there offers to hang out outside of work but i just have no interest in sitting around and talking about nothing with you, i\u2019d rather go home and read or do something that matters to me. But at the same time i feel so lonely and isolated in this world and like I don\u2019t fit in anywhere, everywhere i go i feel like an outkast. I wish I could find like minded people, i hope one day i can find a real friend and someone i can count on, i hope one day i\u2019ll find my girl. It hurts being lonely sometimes i just don\u2019t really like alot of people like that, it feels really uncomfortable for me to open up to people and it takes a while for me to start to feel comfortable, i\u2019ve been in the streets most my life so i realllyy don\u2019t trust people, people not from my background won\u2019t get it.

When this stock of karmic reactions begins to manifest is it called k\u00fata. From the stage of k\u00fata, karma develops into a seedlike stage known as b\u00eeja. This seed stage of karma appears as one\u2019s predisposition and desire. When the seed stage of karma blossoms and actually manifests in our life, this is called pr\u00e1rabdha-karma. Once this karma has blossomed, it must bear its fruit. Although karma in its earlier stages of development can be destroyed by spiritual practice, one\u2019s pr\u00e1rabdha-karma must play itself out. One who has attained knowledge of the self witnesses the expiration of his pr\u00e1rabdha-karma, remaining unattached in the midst of the happiness and distress that it brings about.\"  \n\n\n(Swami BV Tripurari- commentary BG 2.56)",

          "content": "Hi! I was wondering why dogs might bark at me and try to bite me. \n\nI try to do my best at reading and applying spiritual practices and I don't know if I have a good aura but I've been told by random people that I have a good one, but strong spiky at the same time which has gotten me into trouble when there are entities nearby as it threatens them. They have explained it to me as: 'there are good, soft, calm auras that harm no one like soft beautiful lights and there are good but strong auras that come too harsh like the bright light when welding metal that makes some entities uncomfortable.' \n\nI am by no means perfect, like every other person who is trying their best in the spiritual path. However, I tend to be often barked by dogs. Some approach me to bark and try to scare me, one even softly bit my ankle. I don't fear dogs, I like them and I was planning on getting one. Whenever they approach aggressively, I stop and let them try to sniff me. Some might stop but others flinch and bark at me from afar. My emotions are neutral as I tend to be known as somewhat stoic person who doesn't express too many emotions, plus I know they won't really harm me, some of the dogs are really cute, and it's happened many times so I'm sort of used to it. The owners, they are very considerate, grab/carry their dogs back home (as these are let loose on the street without leashes) and apologize for their dogs' erratic behavior. \n\nI was wondering if this meant anything spiritually related that I'm doing something wrong, perhaps my aura isn't that good as I've been told, or it's just the dogs at my neighborhood, a bit of bad luck and I should just let it go.\n\nThanks for reading!",

          "content": "The other day I unintentionally entered a state of meditation. I feel like I just constant border on a state of meditation now. Like I just slip into trances really easily. The other day I was just sitting on a lawn chair on my front porch and I felt like I couldn't feel my body and all I could feel was this sense of spinning. \n\nI believe life is trying to wake me up by putting me through challenges so I'll detach and enter a state of pure consciousness allowing for me to escape our material reality. But part of me still wants to find meaning and joy in material reality but I'm just sort of in this trance. \n\nI feel like I'm starved of true fulfillment and can't find anything fulfilling, causing me to slowly disconnect more and more from the material world. The state I entered the other day started after I was just sitting trying to find some meaning or purpose and all of a sudden I was just a floating soul spinning clockwise.  \n\nPart of me likes and finds meaning and a sense of identity within this state. But I miss feeling the usual joy of the physical world. All my joy comes from putting meaning into things such as my past experience in which I experienced the floating spinning sensation. Like I need to find some sort of narrative or mission handed to me by fate and I'm trying to discover it. That's pretty much all that brings me joy. I have this odd sensation that it's always night even during the day. It just feels like night I can't explain it any other way. I don't think I'll ever be able to enjoy life if I'm being honest. All I can do is find momentary meaning in whatever sort of mental shutdown this is and slap the label \"spiritual awakening\" on it so it's not completely pointless.\n\nbut then I get bored of the whole spiritual awakening thing because it isn't new anymore.\n\nAnd once I get bored it's only a matter of time before I do drugs. I have a bottle of cough syrup sitting in my room if I desperately need to get high on something.\n\nMost recent drug I did was Cannabis which is pretty benign for most. But yesterday had me thinking that I was possessed and that my hallucinations were going to start speaking through me as if I was channeling something. Luckily that never happened. I also worried that if I lost focus of the external world I'd be dragged off to some sort of hell realm by my hallucinations so I just did everything I can to stay grounded, by that I mean pacing back and forth, looking at my surroundings like a crackhead to stay grounded in them, and talking to as many people as possible. Constantly changing up what I was doing to keep my mind from completely zoning out. \n\nI do have psychosis and take meds for it. \n\nBut this feels like a spiritual problem and I need a spiritual solution. Medication doesn't work. The antipsychotics just make me feel more disconnected and antidepressants stop working after a few months.\n\nI want to find something to blame it on externally like \"Oh I'm lonely\" or \"Oh It's because I'm not a world renowned musician yet\". But I know no matter what changes I'd still just get bored of it eventually. Although if I wasn't so lonely I probably wouldn't crave drugs as much and would just opt for cuddling instead. Like if I could just get all affectionate with someone all day every day life wouldn't feel so bad. But that's not realistic, like I need to get a fucking job and all that.\n\nSo medication wont work. Therapy doesn't do much. Last resort is to seek spiritual answers.\n\nI started experiencing whacky spiritual shit after amphetamine use. Like during the withdrawals I had random episodes of bliss that were like brief oases in a desert of painful agitation. I'd feel a presence with me and all my muscles would start relaxing and twitching in a pleasant way. One time one of these random bliss surges almost brought me to tears. \n\nMy voices also make my muscles twitch but in an unpleasant \"zap/shock\" kind of way. \n\nThen the psychosis started after I started smoking weed more heavily to cope with the irritability and agitation when I wasn't experiencing those random spells of bliss as relief. \n\nIt's effectively been all one big downhill trajectory since I had this feeling one day on the prescription amphetamines that \"source/god/the universe\" had giveth me bliss and now he would taketh. It happened after talking to one of my friends downtown actually. I went home and the sinking feeling just wouldn't go away so I started taking more of my doctor sanctioned speed in hopes of drowning it out but it didn't do any good.\n\n Normally I could escape any negative feeling with the speed but this time it was inescapable. One of our friends did some shit that started some drama, the friend group split, resulting in one of my friends that meant a lot to me leaving our entire group and I also left the group because I was pissed at them as well for making my other friend leave. This happened about three months after the sense of impending doom, so this was in June or July of 2021.\n\nI just took as much of my prescription as possible and knocked a hole in my wall out of despair. I was still living at home at the time (just recently moved out actually) and I remember telling my mother as I was in the throws of an amphetamine mediated mental breakdown \"I want to go home\" repeatedly even though I was literally in my own fucking room. \n\nLife has been sort of shit ever since then. \n\n&#x200B;",

I also just recently started listening to vibrational meditation music as I sleep.   \nAnyways, in my dream I think I was watching a video on YouTube. In it, someone was going around a hippie-like festival having fun as a song played over the video, the music would pause or quiet down at moments where the person stopped to talk to someone. Near the end of the video, or at least before I woke up, there was a man talking and he said something along the lines of \"Love is not something you create/generate, it's an energy that always exists and you either feel in any moment or you don't.\" As I watched the video I cried. Soon after that I woke up and thought to myself \"man that was deep.\"  \n\n\nI don't really know what it means or why I dreamt that, but I found it very interesting and a kind of beautiful.   \n",

I\u2019m using a secondary reddit account right now just so no one I know can see this since it\u2019s kind of sensitive. \n\nBut the basic storyline is that since my partner and I met around a year ago, we both had insanely frequent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moments around the other person, like even multiple in one week. Not consecutively, of course. But they were very strong and we both made note of them at separate times, sometimes they would have the experience and I wouldn\u2019t or vice versa, or we would both experience it at the same time. \n\nWe broke up last night. We weren\u2019t fighting or anything, the breakup was completely amicable. It was entirely because of some emotional issues they were having in relation to me that just can\u2019t be fixed. We met up to see each other one final time, as a couple a least. \n\nDuring that, we had hugged and had been crying on each other and we both pulled away at the same time and noted we were both experiencing the same strong d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu we had always gotten. \n\nI\u2019m just heartbroken and trying to search for meaning in all of this, I think. But I would love to hear if anyone has a similar story or any ideas what this could mean for us or our future. We agreed to be friends, maybe in the closer to more distant future, whenever we can both feel a little better.",

I really didn\u2019t believe in meditation but one day at night  I started meditating than about 15 mins in I see a light reflecting on my eye lids and than I open my eyes, it was day time, I got up from the bed because I didn\u2019t believe that I was meditating for 8 hours, when I open my door to go downstairs the stairs were like in a spiral. I started to panic a little because I never seen my house like this everything was shifted or glitching through the walls, I call for help and no one answer my first thought was to run because I started feeling like someone was behind me and felt a really bad energy, when I came out of my house I saw a man with a sword, birds,rabbits, and in the sky it was a really bright light that blinded me every time I saw it, than I walked up to the guy and we started speaking in some other language that I don\u2019t know and I seem to know what we were saying, the man touch my forehead and I went through a vortex, when I came back to my room I had a really bad sleep paralysis long story short I come out of the sleep paralysis and I started to wonder what just happen and want it to know more so I meditated a second time.\n\nThe second time I was in my room, I saw a light in my eye lids again and open my eyes, this time  I see what I perceived  to be women/ even thought it look masculine with a green aura and she started speaking to me in the wierd language again but I do remember what she told me \u201cI will heal you\u201d touch my forehead and back to the vortex and into  another sleep paralysis, but this time I was able to move the first thought I had in my head was to hit the \u201csleep paralysis demon\u201d and when I hit it, it went to my closet when I was able to wake up, I found the door of my closet open and I went to check the outside camera and there wasn\u2019t no footage it was green at the time I was meditating\n\nSince than I had some weird  thoughts and believes that if I say it here people will call me crazy I even hide some things in this post that I saw and keeps happening to me",

Vectors have direction, like velocity or force; they imply movement in a certain direction.\n\nOn this forum, I've noticed a vast range of topics, from phenomena and feelings to beliefs and practices. Some of these topics are like scalars, while others are more like vectors.\n\nFor instance, I follow Sufism, which is very much a vector-oriented path. It has a clear end goal: a journey from the seen to the unseen, ultimately leading to God. Along this path, you encounter various aspects such as life, death, spirits, heavens, and more. However, none of these is the ultimate goal; God Himself is. All the other experiences are valuable by-products.\n\nBut on this forum, I sense that God isn't always the end goal, and that's perfectly fine. Sometimes, the objective is finding inner peace, explaining the unexplained, accepting oneself and the surroundings, exploring the inner psyche, discovering hidden universal energy, or achieving oneness with the universe.\n\nI'd love to learn more about your philosophy too. Maybe we can organize a conference one day, where each philosophy has its own booth. People seeking knowledge could stop by and explore these diverse perspectives.",

I believe in the existence of it and that there are things that happen that are unexplainable, but they never happen to me. I\u2019ve been trying things like astral projection, subliminals, meditation, manifestation, since I was in 5th grade but I\u2019ve never once gotten a sign for anything. And I\u2019m so confused because you\u2019d think at some point something would happen, but it never does for me. Is there something wrong with me? Like is there any reasoning behind it or am I just not trying hard enough? I\u2019m just really confused tbh",

She told me she would convey something my guides wanted me to know at a high level\u2026 so it might resonate with some of you, it might not. But I felt called to share it here. Here\u2019s what she relayed: \n\n\n\ud83c\udf19 \n\n\n\n\u201cThe life you are living now is technically a memory... or will become a memory. You are not living this life right now, you are remembering this life right now. All the lives you have ever lived and all the lives you will ever live have happened simultaneously and you are simply intently focused on this one right here, right now.\n\nYou can bounce your consciousness to one of your other lives, but \"you\u201d, [insert name here], would not know you are doing that.  Only \"you,\" your higher self, would know you are doing that.  \n\nSo from the perspective of the [insert name here] character you are playing in this life, you will only be conscious of this one life.\n\nYour higher self, however, is conscious of all of them and can choose to zoom in or out of any of them.\n\nThe effect they want you to take from this is that you can recall wisdom that you learned in a past or future life and pull it into this life to help you make decisions, gain perspective, and not take life too seriously while at the same time having and creating the best life for yourself that you can.\n\nSo when life seems scary or you feel like it's not going the way you want, try to fly your consciousness level up into the sky and look down on this life as a blip, an important blip yes, but just a blip in eternity. Extract as much joy from it as you can. And try not to worry about anything.\u201d\n\n\n\u2728 \n\n\nHope this helps or enlightens any of you! :)",

Try using language to capture an experience and tell me it isn\u2019t a similar exercise in futility. I\u2019m not saying language is totally useless. A leaky bucket can still hold water. A poem can still elicit a memory or a feeling of an experience. However, no collection of words describing \u201cwetness\u201d will elicit the feeling you have when I push you into a lake.",

I'm trying to get back into a practice, and I'm reading a book that has helped me tremendously in the past, \"Wisdom of No Escape\" by Pema Chodron, except this time, the whole practice of Maitri is completely lost on me. I find it very hard to feel compassionate or friendly, towards myself or towards others.\r  \n\r  \nA couple of weeks ago, my mom got into an accident, and hurt her foot which resulted in a bedrest. I did not have a strong reaction to this news. I am with her 24x7 and have no problems taking care of her, but I do not feel anything about it, positive or negative...\r  \n\r  \nThis aside, I have been finding people to be a chore more and more, and just could do with less interactions with them. The thing is, it's not exactly avoidance I feel when it comes to Maitri towards myself, it's more \"I'm neutral about whatever I'm feeling\". Where previously, I was working with intense emotions and getting to terms with them, now I feel like there's no emotions, or if there are emotions, I'm either not able to label them, or they are very subtle and maybe fly under the radar. Even right now, as I write this, I clearly feel sensations in my body, but I don't know what they are! And how do I develop compassion for something I don't even understand?\r  \nAnother thing that happened: yesterday at the movies I was getting some popcorn with a friend, and while talking to the cashier, apparently my tone must have gotten a bit intense since my friend told me to \"Calm down bro\", but, in that moment I did not feel angry, or at least feel anything that might have registered like anger.\r  \n\r  \nI think I am doing something wrong since I think I am regressing instead of learning more about myself and feeling compassionate towards people, and I don't know how to correct it.",

          "content": "The Parallel Universe Theory and Spiritual Beings\n\nThe concept of parallel universes, also known as the multiverse theory, suggests that there are multiple universes that exist simultaneously alongside our own. These universes may have different physical laws, constants, and even different versions of ourselves. In this context, the idea that humans as spiritual beings are living multiple lives as different people concurrently is a philosophical and metaphysical interpretation of the parallel universe theory.\n\nConcurrent Lives and Spiritual Existence\n\nAccording to this interpretation, humans are not just physical beings living a singular life but are also spiritual entities experiencing multiple lives across different realities. Each individual\u2019s consciousness is not confined to a single existence but rather spans across various incarnations in different universes. These concurrent lives may involve different identities, experiences, and circumstances, all happening simultaneously.\n\nDreams as Glimpses into Other Lives\n\nThe notion that humans occasionally catch glimpses of their concurrent other lives in dreams aligns with the belief that the boundaries between these parallel existences can sometimes become blurred. In this view, dreams serve as windows into these alternate realities, offering fleeting glimpses of people, places, and events from other concurrent lives. These dreams may contain individuals whom the dreamer has never met in their present life and locations they have never visited, yet feel strangely familiar due to their connection to other concurrent existences.\n\nInterconnectedness of Spiritual Realms\n\nProponents of this interpretation often emphasize the interconnectedness of these spiritual realms and the influence they have on each other. They argue that experiences in one concurrent life can impact and resonate across other existences, leading to instances where individuals sense echoes or reflections of their other selves in dreams or moments of deep introspection.\n\nImplications for Personal Growth and Understanding\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, embracing the idea of concurrent lives as spiritual beings can lead to a deeper exploration of personal identity, empathy, and interconnectedness with others. It encourages individuals to consider the broader implications of their actions and experiences beyond the confines of a single lifetime, fostering a sense of unity with their other selves across different realities.\n\nIn summary, the concept that humans as spiritual beings are living multiple lives concurrently within parallel universes offers a unique perspective on the nature of existence and personal identity. It intertwines elements of metaphysics, spirituality, and interconnectedness while providing an intriguing framework for understanding the complexities of human consciousness.",

The churches have always proved the staunchest upholders of the grossest form of worldliness from which even the worst of non-ecclesiastical criminals are found to recoil.  \n\n\nIt is not from any deliberate opposition to the ordained clergy that these observations are made. The original purpose of the established churches of the world may not always be objectionable. But no stable religious arrangement for instructing the masses has yet been successful. The Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in pursuance of the teachings of the scriptures enjoins all absence of conventionalism for the teachers of the eternal religion. It does not follow that the mechanical adoption of the unconventional life by any person will make him a fit teacher of religion. Regulation is necessary for controlling the inherent worldliness of conditional souls.  \n\n\nBut no mechanical regulation has any value, even for such a purpose. The bona-fide teacher of religion is neither any product of nor the favourer of any mechanical system. In his hands no system has, likewise, the chance of degenerating into a lifeless arrangement. The mere pursuit of fixed doctrines and fixed liturgies cannot hold a person to the true spirit of doctrine or liturgy.  \nThe idea of an organized church in an intelligible form, indeed, marks the close of the living spiritual movement. The great ecclesiastical establishments are the dikes and the dams to retain the current that cannot be held by any such contrivances. They, indeed, indicate a desire on the part of the masses to exploit a spiritual movement for their own purpose. They also unmistakably indicate the end of the absolute and unconventional guidance of the bona-fide spiritual teacher. The people of this world understand preventive systems, they have no idea at all of the un-prevented positive eternal life. Neither can there be any earthy contrivance for the permanent preservation of the life eternal on this mundane plane on the popular scale.\"  \n*P\u016btan\u0101 - by \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura Prabhup\u0101da*",

Her name has been changed out of respect for privacy.\n\n-Dreamt Emily died\n\n-that she died by su**cide, but I knew that it was framed to look like that. I suspect her husband \n\n- I was at house for some reason, her husband never physically there in dream but I kept hearing him incoherently and I knew he was being a dick even though he never said anything that make sense it was all mumbled \n\nwhen I was in house, her husband was in the back doing something. I used this time to look for clues. On the side of the house was a motion light like I have, so could see if he went  past so I could avoid getting caught. His phone was charging by front door, I had to unplug his phone as well as cable in way of door, and put door on latch (same as my door) but not fully lock it so I could quickly unlock before he noticed  \n\n- I looked in mirror and asked what you wanted me to do, and what she wanted me to do that's best for her baby  I screamed in mirror crying \n\n-people selling stuff on street idk what though, I told them you'd love it (think it was shoes), and then I cried because she spoke about you like you were alive as I didn't tell her you died. She call the company on that store, and they agrees I could have good from the store because of your death\n\n- I think I woke up in my dream while still dreaming, because last thing that happened was I asked my other 2 friends if Emily really died, and they said no and were all confused\n\n- at the end, some weird creature that looked like logs of a tree killed them. It k*lled them both and I woke up in real life then",

I was not sure about making this soul tie with him as he has had some interesting and scary spiritual experiences and I know there are spirits that linger around him (They are generally repelled by my energy). So after I come home from college , my grandmother says she can feel the soul tie and starts praying for me the entire day. Two other people in my family said they\u2019ve cried for me. & My aunt said that she felt unsettled when looking at me and everyone was essentially hinting that my soul was in some kind of turmoil, which is off because they\u2019ve only said this a few days ago & i\u2019ve had this soultie for  months. I\u2019ve been around my family and they haven\u2019t said anything like this before. They are christian and essentially told me i was living in sin and the whole talk of shit i already knew. Essentially the entire family was talking about me being sexually active and how i\u2019m not doing well in my soul . The thing is my soul has always been in turmoil I guess you can say. I\u2019ve struggled with religion from a very young age & they\u2019ve seen that barely and all of sudden when I have a soultie they can feel it ?? I have been in the same turmoil since 12, now there\u2019s just a soul tie on top. I am not christian and I am more spiritualist. I\u2019m not sure what may have changed and my family is pretty spiritually  accurate but christian\u2019s can be cultish sometimes and my family has done very horrible things in the name of christianity.

          "content": "Me and my current gf have been together for quite a while, about 8 years now. I\u2019m a spiritual guy who sees truth in all religions but also see the bs in it, she\u2019s a Christian who\u2026 is still learning. Additionally I believe in a plant based diet for many reasons, and morals being one, however she is not. For the longest I\u2019ve tried to tell myself these are small things, but as I\u2019ve carried on through my journey they have grown in significance greatly, and the differences are harder to ignore especially being that I don\u2019t really have anyone else to talk to about these things- we used to have open minded conversations all the time, now every subject is sensitive or frustratingly hard to explain. And now, we\u2019ve welcomed a child into this work\u2026 and with that, our differences in how we want to raise our child are exposing the tension we\u2019ve held back for so long. \n\nThe things we used to ignore, on an \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d kind if scale, are issues we can\u2019t move past and instead of talking it out, we just stop talking because we\u2019d rather not clash\u2026 but how long will this last?? She\u2019s my first love, we\u2019ve been through a lot and have grown so much together, and I see so much for us\u2026 but am I delusional? I don\u2019t know\u2026 I know our differences are amplified for me at least because I already feel alone enough, I don\u2019t have any friends of my own to chat with on a daily basis, definitely none to have deep talks and connections with, none with beliefs even close. I do value having different views, I see it as helping expanding my horizons and proving different perspectives\u2026 but can a healthy relationship grow from views that clash so hard? \n\nWith that being said, I\u2019m open to making new friends and chatting more\u2026 I know there aren\u2019t too many specific details, I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m trashing her and also don\u2019t want to speak so much negativity out into existence, so I\u2019ll leave it at that. All I know is, I feel like I\u2019m in a losing battle more than ever, in between just trying to keep the peace and pushing my own values to the side, and fully diving into my journey and standing on my beliefs even if it makes me the bad guy in the eyes of those I know, based on nothing other than being different. I\u2019m cordial with everyone and everyone is pretty accepting of who they think I am, but I don\u2019t open up too much because I\u2019m already kind of a black sheep, but I truly don\u2019t want to be that lonely, ya know.

          "content": "Disclaimer: I know this is like a dirty word after those documentaries came out, but I do have a divine counterpart (twin flame) and if you don\u2019t believe in them, that\u2019s cool, but this post isn\u2019t for you. \n\nOkay, I have never met anyone else who identifies with the specifics of my journey, but I\u2019m praying SOMEONE here will. Pls I would like to know if you\u2019ve experienced anything similar.\n\nBasically, I feel that my person and I have shared work to do. \n \nFor context, I had an awakening (by way of a karmic catalyst) that began in 2018. And culminated in a kind of ego death experience in   2020. My twin had what he calls a Kundalini awakening, I believe in 2015. And went on to follow a yogic path. We didn\u2019t meet until summer 2020 through his work as a yoga teacher and mentor. \n\nI was meeting with him as a client initially but things quickly got muddy. Anyway, in our last meeting together he said himself that he could tell I was meant to do the same work as him. \n\nLater in my journey, after we were separated and were no longer speaking, I got downloads about our shared business/brand. I built our brand guidelines, a social media strategy, and email copy for a brand launch in a span of days. It was an insane creative wave. And it felt SO exciting. Like it was exactly what I\u2019m meant to do. \n\nBut of course, we weren\u2019t in contact, and as much as I wanted it then, I eventually understood there were likely still things to be cleared/learned/resolved on either side.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s been 2 years, now, officially, since we last spoke. While I do think I have seen evidence of healing in him and certainly know I\u2019ve felt it in me, he\u2019s still not here.\n\nBut meanwhile, I have been guided towards learning new things (getting a yoga certification, which I didn\u2019t even intend to do), learning astrology, yoga and other tools and modalities, lenses through which we analyze our souls evolution. \n\nI\u2019ve also been healing and transforming so no time is wasted. \n\nBut No other job/career development opportunity has shown up for me, and it\u2019s not for lack of me putting out applications. \n\nI\u2019ve worked part time as a barista at the top of this year for a few months, but beyond that I haven\u2019t worked a job since the top of 2021. \n\nNow I\u2019ve been provided for, in truly exceptional ways, ways I never could have imagined for myself. But I have had financial struggles along the way. And just a lack of stability. \n\nI\u2019ve been growing, no doubt about it, learning lessons about scarcity/abundance, about trusting my intuition, about so much more on my spiritual journey so far. I\u2019ve also been (and there\u2019s no better way to say this) waiting. \n\nNow I know all this rhetoric about loving yourself, serving yourself, focusing on yourself. Trust me when I say, this is a lesson I\u2019ve already learned. I am not gripping onto him or an idea of who he is so that he can come fill me up. I am whole. And I don\u2019t even need him as a romantic partner. \n\nBut this work\u2026.it feels like what I\u2019m made for. Specifically WITH him. I have tried to outrun it, to commit to other jobs, to tell myself I\u2019m crazy. Nothing works. \n\nThis work feels imperative and inevitable. I just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s meant to come to fruition, and not having other opportunities in the meantime is challenging. I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nSo I said all this to ask if anyone else feels they share a mission with their twin and can\u2019t move on with their purposeful work alone.",

          "content": "My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over two years. We're both female, and she's a bit older than me, for context. We live together and I feel like she is the only person I can trust and connect with. I have family and friends, and have had previous relationships, but she is the only person who has (and ever has had) access to the deepest parts of me. I have struggled with depression since I was 9 (I'm 21 now), and was suicidal during the first year of our relationship, due to circumstances that had nothing to do with her. It got to the point where she saw me suffering so much that she respected my choice to die, if I were to make it. I had been looking into psilocybin for years, and decided to try it, since I felt I had nothing to lose. My girlfriend was with me the whole time, and supported me during my very spiritually charged trip. It was my last resort for my depression, and it worked. I won't say I never feel sad or upset, but years of suicidal ideation and severe, debilitating depression melted away. It had its setbacks, but that's not was this post is about. Because of the psilocybin, I was finally able to get a job and be financially independent. I finally felt joy, and had a bit of a spiritual awakening after the shrooms wore off. I felt inclined to make changes in my life to help me become more spiritually concious, but I eventually fell into old habits. I'm not depressed or suicidal, but I feel stuck in my unhealthy ways and consumed by my ego self. \n\nThe psilocybin trip was one year ago, almost exactly. Recently, I felt myself awakening again. Everything around me started going wrong. My health started failing, I ended up in the emergency room twice in less than 4 days, and money has become very tight. Random appliances need expensive repairs (most need to be replaced) and the tires in my car keep popping. I cannot afford any repairs, so I have a family member doing my laundry for me and I need to shower out of a bucket (my water heater burst). Out of nowhere, my father (who I had a normal relationship with up to this point) decided to sue me, due to matters relating to my mother's death. I've become very stressed and paranoid, can barely sleep, and my relationship has been affected significantly by our financial struggles and my emotional state. My girlfriend implied that I may be cursed, but I disagree. It is my belief that the universe is all but forcing me to wake up and make the changes necessary to become the spiritual version of myself I want to be. I was in peace with all this chaos, until it started affecting my relationship.\n\nMy girlfriend is very open minded, but spiritual talk scares her. For her, it's all about darkness, ghosts, and negative energy. She and I can have enlightening conversations about my general beliefs regarding conciousness, the universe, the soul, etc., but the second things get a little \"dark\" (astral projection, lucid dreaming, messages from spirits, seeing shadows from the corners of my eyes, eerie coincidences), she checks out. In these cases, she automatically assumes it's all in my head and I may need psychological help. I think it's her fear of the unknown, of the non material world, and of things she doesn't understand. I don't blame her, but I desperately feel the need to be supported on this journey, and I feel like she cannot provide that. I feel like my ego self wants the validation, wants to feel seen and heard, and this is the only way it knows how to, since she is the only person who really knows me. But I also know this is a lot of pressure to put on a person, and I will not expect her to engage in conversations or explore beliefs that she does not feel comfortable exploring. \n\nSpirituality has become such an important part of my life during these past 2 months, probably because it offered peace during the absolute chaos around me. Now I feel like my relationship is crumbling because I don't feel supported, and I seem to lack the ability to connect to others enough to have these types of conversations. I understand that this is a me issue and an ego issue, but I also think it is valid and human nature to want support. I understand that it's not valid to expect one person to provide that support when she does not want to.\n\nMy girlfriend is currently extremely anxious because I mentioned that I've felt very connected to the spirit world lately. She developed an intense fear of the dark. I didn't think providing general info on my spiritual awakening was a scary subject (I know now), but now she's thinking about ghost tales and the house being haunted. I don't want to make her seem childish, but sometimes it feels like the open minded person I came to love is now paralyzed in fear. She also has no interest in awakening, and I have no interest in forcing her to. I worry about her mental state being affected by my spiritual awakening, since there will be changes in my behavior with my spiritual transformation, even if I don't mention them. \n\nI'm not willing to break it off, but we are fighting more than ever (ugly fights about things that are very important to me but she sees as little things, nothing physical) and I feel lost. What do I do? How can I find people who are willing to have these conversations with me, so I don't burden my partner? How do I go through this process without giving my gf an anxiety disorder? Does anyone have a partner who sees spirituality as an absolute no? I'm open to criticism as well.",

The first couple times, I didn't think much of it because I often have very vivid dreams about people I know, and many times they don't really make much sense.  But this particular person kept reappearing (probably like 4 or 5 times). And the last few times, the dreams were \"more than friendly.\" In the last two dreams, we were cuddled up very close in a cozy embrace. It felt very romantic, but I don't think I feel that way about him.  I feel like I see him like a brother or something in real life.\nSo my question is...should I be concerned that I am developing feelings for this person or just not really think too far into it? I often have a habit of praying for him whenever I think of him...just to make sure he's ok. Does that have something to do with these dreams? Is that creating a fondness that might be contributing to deeper emotions like love? \nAll answers are welcome, but I am particularly eager to hear from people who have spiritual and metaphysical insight.\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff",

But lemme tell yous omg so like I have usually been taking more walks at night since my sleeping schedule is fked and I have been seeing shadow figures walk past on the other side of the road, and this one time I was with two friends of mine and they was arguing and I had left to go home, my bus stop was across the road from them so I could pretty much hear everything and see them if i peaked around the corner, once I walked to the bus stop sat down and peaked I seen a lady in a bright yellow top who looked like they was right next to them in their eyesight trying to calm the argument down, I couldn\u2019t hear her until I would move back around the corner. I hopped on my bus and went past them and the lady was staring at me. I questioned my friends about it and they said they had never seen a lady in BRIGHT YELLOW. I would like to add my Father and other family members have this gift. I\u2019m just so confused on why now. I feel like a superhero tho so its kinda cool.",

Then I thought I found happiness this past year, I finally found a job after being unemployed for a while. It was just a food service job but I was finally self sufficient and made a lot of friends.

It was a captivating experience, and one particular episode left an indelible mark.\n\nBob started a new painting by putting a layer of color onto the canvas, a bold blue that nearly covered all of the space. I was baffled; it seemed as if he had carelessly destroyed his canvas, leaving no room for anything else. What in the world is he doing? I thought. But in reality, he possessed a vision beyond my grasp.\n\nWith every stroke, he defied my expectations. Layer upon layer, he mixed colors and breathed life into the canvas. From that same bold blue backdrop emerged majestic mountains, delicate trees, charming houses, graceful birds, and lush bushes. It was a symphony of colors and shapes, a masterpiece of depth and intricacy that far surpassed my fifth-grade doodles. Bob Ross was a true master of his craft.\n\nWhen Hindus seek to connect with their deities, they turn to a piece of stone. With unwavering devotion, they chip away, hammering and whittling, until the stone takes on a sacred form. Through every resounding blow, it finds its shape and purpose.\n\nRemarkably, the stone never objects to the relentless punishment; it simply endures blow after blow. Once the features are meticulously carved, the idol is bathed in milk and revered as a deity, a source of spiritual connection and guidance.\n\nIn much the same way, our own life experiences shape our character. The first encounters may appear as random strokes on the canvas of our existence, leaving us confused. But as time unfolds, each experience contributes to the grand design.\n\nFrom those seemingly haphazard layers of colors emerge the distinct shapes of our personalities. The challenges we face, akin to the strikes on the sculptor's stone, chisel away to reveal our unique features. It's through unanswered questions and unforeseen hurdles that a clear, profound picture emerges.\n\nTime, always moving forward, assumes the role of an artist. We, the living beings, are its canvas, and our experiences, like brushstrokes and strikes, bring forth the masterpiece of our lives. It's a reminder that we, too, are sculpted by time's hand, evolving into the remarkable works of art that we are destined to become.\n\nTime is an artist, and we are its art.",

You can say I\u2019m lacking in faith and trust. \n\nI think what\u2019s caused this is doing TOO much searching/reading (astral projection, quantum physics, metaphysics, non duality, etc) that I\u2019ve lost sense of the basics - be aware, be a good person. \n\nI notice that i\u2019m also salty that I hear many people having spiritual experiences (obe\u2019s/nde\u2019s *not that brushing with death is a good thing!!*, life reviews, spirit contacts), and I wonder why not me (although I did induce astral projection once briefly but haven\u2019t been able to again). I also notice the irony of seeking so hard, being so ego and thought led that makes having these experiences difficult. \n\nIt feels like there\u2019s a secret out there that i\u2019m not allowed to know.\n\nI guess i\u2019m just looking to see if anyone has advice, or can share their perspective on these topics or has struggled with something like this before.\n\nThank you!",

We did get her for $50 at a garage sale, so we always joked about how she was a great find. She was super funny and outgoing, she would sleep with me every night, I would take her on car rides and she was my animal soulmate. I live 5 hours away from my hometown and my mom had let me know a few months earlier that JoJo wasn\u2019t doing well and that she just wanted me to be aware. I got a text from my mom and I knew it was about my dog. She was telling me that JoJo had been pooping and throwing up blood, sleeping a lot and not eating so I knew it wasn\u2019t good. I took off work on Saturday and drove home to spend her last moments with her. I kept thinking about how she spent the last night with me in my bed the night before I left for college and I wanted to spend the last day with her before she passed. We gave her a spa day, she got some Turkey and potato chips (she loves chips) and some chocolate. I was there when we put her down, I held her on the way home from the vet and then we buried her. After that, I was seeing a lot of Angel numbers, specifically 111 and 222, and was seeing flocks of birds everywhere, but last night I was watching \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d with Leonardo DiCaprio, and I\u2019ve seen this movie a few times but forgot about this one scene. The night before I was talking to her in my mind, telling her that she was such a good dog and that I wish things would\u2019ve been different, and asked if she was giving me those signs from the other side. I told her to keep sending me signs to let me know she was okay and happy. This scene in Don\u2019t Look Up shocked me. Leonardo is talking about how he was really sad because their families dog JoJo had to be put down last year and I was just shocked. Where do animals go? Can animals send us signs?

          "author": "Original-Isopod731",
          "content": "Ho'oponopono is a traditional Hawaiian healing practice that uses a simple mantra to release negative emotions, thoughts, and experiences.\n\nThis ancient spiritual tradition honors the Hawaiian belief about the interconnectedness of all things and the power of thoughts and words to shape reality. At its core, Ho'oponopono is the practice of forgiveness and reconciliation as a means to improve one's relationships with others and the wider world.\n\nHo'oponopono, an oral tradition that has been passed down through the ages, is still an essential aspect of Hawaiian culture; it involves accepting \"total responsibility,\" asking for forgiveness, and owning up to one's mistakes as part of a strong group effort to effect positive change.   \n\nIn fact, ho'oponopono teaches us that our thoughts and deeds affect other people. It also teaches us that compassion and empathy are necessary for true healing on a personal and global level. After all, we are all connected, and what affects one, affects the whole.  \n\nWHAT IS HO'OPONOPONO PRAYER ?? \n\nHo'oponopono, which means \"to right a wrong,\" is a short phrase that is spoken repeatedly to bring balance and peace back to areas where they have been lost.\n\nIt is very easy to use the ho'oponopono prayer for ancestral healing, relationship conflicts, and community healing. Some people even use it as a daily meditation or mindfulness practice, repeating the prayer on a regular basis to keep a positive outlook, elevate their energetic vibration, and release any negativity that may have built up over time. Here it is:\n\n**\"I'm sorry, please forgive me, thank you, I love you.\"**\n\nTHE MEANING OF HO'OPONOPONO ?\n\nBefore beginning the Ho'oponopono prayer, clear your mind of any distractions and unfavorable ideas. Then, concentrate only on the words you are speaking and the present moment. \n\nIn order to send healing vibrations to someone you are praying for, it is vital to keep your attention on them. You do not have to know the person or people you are praying for personally.\n\nNow, let's break down what Ho'oponopono means:\n\n\\- Saying \"I am sorry\" is simply a way to acknowledge that wrong was done. This is because we are all one, and what affects one, affects the other. That being said, saying \"I am sorry\" is an important tool in cultivating humility and grace. The ho'oponopono prayer begins with this statement: \"You are responsible for anything that has ever happened to you, or anything wrong that you have witnessed.\"\n\n\\- This is the Ho'oponopono repentance step, \"Please forgive me.\" In this step, you ask for forgiveness for whatever wrong you are trying to right, even if you were not directly responsible for it. It defuses negativity, reminds you that everyone is equal, and promotes healing for all.\n\n\\- Saying 'Thank You : Expressing appreciation is a key part of the Ho'oponopono practice. Healing and positive life changes can result from cultivating an optimistic and appreciative mental state.\n\n\\- I love you: Saying \"I love you\" is a powerful technique to bring about forgiveness, as well as a way to release bad ideas and emotions, as well as a way to promote inner peace and harmony. It is a declaration of love and acceptance addressed towards oneself, others, and the cosmos. The concept of \"I love you\" in Ho'oponopono is to develop self-love and to recognize that everything and everyone is a part of the same universal consciousness. You can start the process of healing and transformation in your relationships with other people and in yourself by expressing love and compassion.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, unless you let go, unless you forgive yourself, unless you forgive the situation, unless you realize that the situation is over, you cannot move forward.\u201d \u2013 Steve Maraboli\n\nI often repeat the healing prayer while looking in the mirror while working out on the treadmill, and this is a great way to fully integrate the Ho'oponopono prayer for healing into your daily routine.\n\nYou can grab [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s_dgmikZTX7-BSQH4rEvOzFihFrLCx6i/view?usp=sharing) as in .pdf so you can have it in your phone and pray anytime and anywhere you want.\n\nThanks me later !

I'd like to know what a process like this could be about, are there any underlying reasons for someone going through something like this or have these events just been random coincidences?\n\nIn a way you could say that this process has been going on for 12-13 years, since during my high school years I started to feel quite detached from the people around me and this is when the period of my loneliness started. Ever since then I haven't really been able to meet people that I could resonate with or vice versa and have been desperately trying to search for my place in this world with the right people around me. But anyways, in the beginning this loneliness was quite hard to take and caused me to be very depressed and anxious. Later on, I've gotten used to it.\n\nThe major traumatic events in my life have been going on for around 7-8 years now. It all started with me developing a sort of infection cycle that caused me to be sick pretty much all the time for around 2-3 years. Every time I'd gotten better from the last virus/flu I'd very soon be hit with something new again and I was also feeling very weak and powerless otherwise. It took a long time to understand what the reasons behind this were and also the medical system couldn't help me in any way. This process was due to me pushing myself over my limits and burning out and me being a vegetarian/vegan for around five years. The vegetarian/vegan diet simply didn't work for me, and I developed severe deficiencies that caused my health to crash. At the lowest point of this phase I felt so weak that walking 1km was exhausting...\n\nEventually I started to understand the reasons for my ill health and did everything I possibly could to get my health back and bounce back from this. When I started to feel better and had worked tremendously to achieve it my dad got diagnosed with cancer. He still lived for a year, but I had to basically watch him slowly fade away, go through many surgeries and battle mentally with being in this situation and try to support him. Before he died there wasn't much left of this man.\n\nAfter his death I had to take care of my father\u2019s farm in the countryside that he'd been living on. My dad lived off of cultivating farmland, but he didn't have any animals or anything like that. He was also a bit of a hoarder and had huge amounts of junk and machinery all around the farm. Nothing was in order and also otherwise inheriting his land and the farm was a completely new situation for me since I lived in the city with my mom and had never had any interest in these things. Somehow, I survived this process even after everything I'd gone through and luckily, I got some help from other people whereas others made everything as difficult as they could. Luckily, after this I didn't have to live poorly as a student anymore.\n\nAfter things started to seem better with the inheritance and my health, I felt like I was in the best shape of my entire life both mentally and physically. I was very eager to finally start my life. I got admitted to a new master's programme that I was very excited about, since this would mean that I'd be able to have the chance to make new friends and live the life of a normal young man. This hope and excitement didn\u2019t last long, since very soon after this covid started, and I realized that this new chance would never come to fulfillment, since in my country they kept all the universities closed during this whole period. The disappointment was insane, because I realized that the process of me being almost in complete isolation would still go on, and during that time no one knew how long it would last. This was mentally extremely hard to take.\n\nAfter the covid restrictions were removed, I obviously thought that now I'll finally be able to start building my life. A few weeks passed with life being normal and after a basketball game of mine I went to the grocery store and got some kind of seizure that caused me to faint and get cramps all over my body. Still to this day no one knows what it was about. Didn't have epilepsy or anything like that. Anyways, this seizure caused me to fall down on the floor. I hit my head so hard on the floor that I fractured my skull, which caused bleeding in the meninges in my skull, which required surgery. I was taken to the hospital, they cut my skull open so that they could stop the bleeding and that there wouldn't be any pressure on my brain that could cause severe brain damage. They were successful, but despite this I got a moderate brain Injury from the hit on my head on another part of my brain. This sounds weird but I'm 198cm/6'6 tall so that's why the hit was so hard.\n\nThis has been the lowest point of my life, I've recovered well from the brain injury and the long-lasting damage of it has been quite minor, but mentally I've been in ruins. A very traumatic experience and obviously you'll wonder what you are good for in this life anymore, since you have a been injured in such devastating a way. The surgery also left me with and ugly large scar on my head, seven plates of titanium on my skull that are sticking out (luckily I have very thick hair) and a slightly disfigured skull. My intelligence and my looks were the last things I was proud of myself despite things not having gone my way otherwise in this life, so I felt like I've been stripped off of everything I had.   \n\n\nSo what can be the spiritual explanations of someone going through this much trauma in their life without getting a break? How can I find hope in this life again and find joy and happiness again? Especially understanding that these things weren't meaningless and that I still serve some kind of purpose in this world would help me with going on and pushing through despite these obstacles.\n\nAll answers and insights will be highly appreciated!",

Therefore, after success happiness disappears. It seems to appear a pleasure but soon is gone. The truth is success doesn't create happiness. But happiness by itself is success. We have to overcome the myth and that we believe that if we are successful, we will be happy. In fact, if the other way around if we are happy, we will be successful. After we are successful, are we content, are we satisfied? No. Our need becomes a greed. Our desires and passions overtake us and there is stress and anxiety. So, we are never happy.",

I've sometimes felt strong emotions while meditating (both visualizing and without visualization). Being a 32 yo male, I find it hard to tell about my feelings and the way I emotionally react to certain life situations to my friends. They just say I overthink.\n\nI'm sure being a highly sensitive person (hsp) has it's strenghs and advantages, but I'm not aware of these, so I just look at the negatives and can't find a way of strengthening my self-esteem. So I came here for suggestions. How do you channel your sensitivity through your life? Any hobbies that make this part of you spark? Should I focus more of my time on seeking union with the Divine instead of doing so with people? I crave more connection, but I can't get this type of connection from the people I'm surrounded with. Could it be that HSP are more spiritually inclined and that we should strongly cultivate our mystical side to function properly so we have something to channel our strong emotions to?\n\nEdit: sensible to sensitive",

Please read and help, could possibly save lives\ud83d\ude4f\n\nHi so firstly id like to apoligise in advance for the way i come across or for anything wrong with my post. Im not very good at expressing myself or words. Also sorry if you misinterpret my post by the title or anything in the post itself. Im really trying here. I don't know where to start but I'll just start with experience and what I'm in urgent need of help with now. If this isn't the only place I should ask or another place that might help me plz point me In the right direction\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4fanybody else ever experienced this and/or have any advice or info that'll help sort this out or anything that I could use to help cope and end these attacks and protect myself and others. Also any info or advice on supporting other people that are going through the same thing/similar experience/s.\n\nIll start with telepathy. I'm not new to telepathy(not the greatest or very good at it) but I do need all the advice n help I can get surrounding anything to do with it(especially the attacks and harassment or torture from other people with evil intentions wanting to cause harm to others)I've dealt with negative and positive experiences, some negative experiences screwed me up abit but I'm trying to heal and work on myself and ive come along way(still not the best and always trying to learn and grow)some positive have guided me, taught me alot and helped me. but now i need to reach out to all possible places I can for help with this or anything I should know and learn regarding the darkside of spirituality. Need as much info and advice as possible please\n\nThe issue that I need urgent help with now is losing control of myself/not staying connected to myself completely/not being able to connect with people that can help me when i need help and someone with evil intentions trying to cause harm is able to somehow hijack me, my whole body, my mind and like take over to a degree it's a struggle to fight to stay connected to myself and stay in control of myself and be me and my true self in these situations. I'm worried that with the evil people trying to cause harm being in control of someone they could walk someone off a bridge, stop them from breathing or stop their heart from beating or anything like that. Which I feel like I should add are all real experiences. But could these evil people be able to remotely take another's life? Like what are we dealing with here cos it's abit of a worry",

It felt so good that I had been granted that opportunity and manifestation WORKS. I manifested the exact week the applications would open. At this time I felt more content with my life and how it was going. \n\nHOWEVER.\n\nThat job was a mistake. A very big mistake in my opinion. The only good it served was to make me let go of the desire for working there. I thought it would ensure my happiness but it did the opposite. Things weren\u2019t necessarily bad or toxic, they just felt very wrong and unsuitable to me.   \nI missed out on spending time in the summer with my animals due to the workload. Now two of them have passed and I will never get that time back. I gained a new habit of insomnia, which still affects me 4 months later. Extra stress. \n\nI quit the job after a month. \n\nSo, my manifestation worked, but the universe was clearly telling me that it was not for me. Now I am reluctant to manifest anything else. I wonder if it was some sort of backfire for thinking I could change my reality myself rather than praying. I tried really hard for that job and can\u2019t help but feel like I sabotaged myself for getting it. \n\n&#x200B;",

          "content": "This will be a very long post with many layers to it, so bear with me.\n\nWhen I was a child, I had this irrational fear of death. A toddler thinking about death is weird and was probably not something my parents knew how to deal with. They did their best, but what can you do, you know? Anyways, when I was a kid, I would have this reoccurring night terror that I died on a Victorian train cause the tunnel was collapsing. That dream would mess with me because even after I had woken up, I would feel bigger than I was like my blanket felt small. My heart would be pounding, and I didn't feel real. Sometimes, my Mom would come in to comfort me, telling me later that it was like I was looking through her, not at her. I don't remember seeing her coming in to comfort me; I only remember her voice, like I was blind. I would have that night terror for years until I was probably 8 or 9 when my Dad woke me up in the middle of it, and it never came back after that. There was also one time I swear to god I saw, which this will sound stupid, but I saw glowing neon skeletons pulling themselves out of my wall. I wasn't dreaming I woke up to that. I've also had genuine, very frequent Deja Vu like I had a dream about my 7th-grade Global Issues class in 4th grade. Everything was exactly as it was in the dream, excluding one or two kids being different. \n\nMy fear of death went away throughout middle school and high school until senior year when it was brought back to me by my friend talking about how she died and came back. The fear kicked up with frequent anxiety attacks and stuff. Nothing major, though, cause I was dealing with other issues that masked that issue, I guess. A year of therapy, exploring spirituality/religion, and surviving an abusive guy later. Now, I am at this moment where I have nothing to worry about, but death cause everything is going well for me. Here's the problem, though: I don't fear death so I don't know what is actually going on. I have a therapist, and I take medicine for my ADHD, but I have no other apparent neurological issues as far as I know. You might now be wondering what this has to do with negative spirits; I did a thing.\n\nSo, one night in my senior year, I got bored and openly invited ghosts into my mind. That sounds ridiculous and strange now that I typed it out, but I did that. I had this vivid dream of arguing with a woman in a household, and then I was in a low-angle POV going down a hospital hallway, almost like I was lying in a bed. Then I felt something lying next to me that wouldn't let go of me, so I had to kick it and punch it away. Nothing happened again after that. \n\nRecently, the fear of death or I should say the dread feeling, is getting stronger. I am working with my therapist to work through it. Reddit wasn't my first pick, lol. I know nothing about the spiritual realm or what's cooking there. Maybe anyone who knows about it could shed insight into all of that. I'll answer questions people ask me or any insights, which could be medical ones. For now, though, I will say that I know to keep working with my therapist. I don't need anyone telling me that. I had a response saying that once, and I was like cool, I already know that. I'm looking more toward the spiritual side of things, but again, if anyone knows psychology, that would be cool.\n\n&#x200B;",

Every scheduled time, we rotate. \n\nThen I made some friends who I would watch the games with together. And then rotate out, like in a conference,  to catch specific events. It was so nice to meet up later after our specific events.\n\nI then recall, it seemed I was playing different roles and then get out of it (events). I had this one close friend where we would run  around together to catch our 'events'. \nA specific conversation is what I recalled and I haven't stop thinking about it.\n\nRemember the roles you have to play per event, It looked like we keep racing to catch our events/rooms. One time, my friend stops me to say 'This is you' -it was a person. He found my event for me. I asked 'how do you know? How do I know how to find 'me'? Then he describes what to look for, but I can't remember what it was.\n\nAfter that, he asked, 'Do you understand what we are doing now?' . I respond with so much conviction by saying 'oh yes, this is about past lives and we go around multiple times to learn....' I can't remember what I said after that.\n\nThe strange thing is, the moment I said that, the scene scrambled up and I became scared. It turned into darkness and when I could see again, I was no longer at that arena and me and my buddy were sea horses.\n\nPS: No psychedelics were consumed prior to dream. Also, I just went through a major surgery a week ago and recovering. Oxy?",

We fight if we feel injustice, because we are defending humanity. We work for humans, and we are with humans. There are us and there are the others, those who tarnish us, because that is their way of being and doing. Let\u2019s say they feed on that, so as not to be vulgar. So, what is left for us to do except to be totally sovereign and free. I'm talking here about who comes to mind, what influences us, what wants more for us than we want for ourselves, in a sense that is not constantly positive. If there was no enemy, we would not be the hero of our film. And because we must be centric, these visible and invisible enemies will do everything to keep us in a weak, heavy and low-vibration state. Don't believe in hazard. This word doesn't even exist. It came from itself. It is meaningless and makes no sense. Synchronicity on the other hand is anything that makes sense. We receive this as a message to us and it is. Even if the mind creates meaning, there is also meaning in that, and therefore, the laws that govern us cannot reject what is there for us at the moment we experience it.\r  \n\n\nSo I got to 330 words before realizing that I had far exceeded 100 words.

          "content": "This might not be the best place to post this as it is drug related but I consider myself a person with spiritual beliefs and I want to see if you guys have had similar experiences, so I feel that I\u2019m not alone. \n\nI haven\u2019t been feeling so great lately. In August of 2022 I went to kayak at the lake with a friend and drop a tab of acid. The acid kicked in way later than normal, by the time it hit it got dark and we were already done kayaking. So we were just sitting at the pier waiting for the acid to wear off so we could get back home. This friend was probably not the best guy to trip with because he\u2019s kind of reckless and untrustworthy, so I started getting really paranoid. The pitch black darkness of the night made it way worse, I felt like I entered the eternal void and the universe was just full of meaninglessness. I started having derealization and feeling like nothing is real, then I had a panic attack. Overall the trip was really bad but by the time I got home and started coming down I had the most insane visuals of my life while staring at the bathroom tiles. It was the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Because of that I know that it was acid and not nbome.\n\nAnyways after that trip it kinda of traumatized me even though it ended on a good note. That sense of void and meaninglessness continued, I kept feeling anxious, and derealization persisted. I felt like nothing was real and it was all an illusion. I believe I developed HPPD because I would look at my bathroom tiles and see them slowly shifting, I believe they call it visual snow. These feeling continued for a few months and by January of 2023 it got a lot better. Pretty much all the symptoms were gone besides the visual snow. I felt good again.\n\nFast forward to summer of 2023 I started smoking weed again, and everytime I smoked I\u2019d get anxious, paranoid, derealized all over again. A couple times I had really bad panic attacks where I genuinely felt like I was dying. It felt like a full on LSD trip when I smoked weed. The visual snow would intensify also. One time I got so high I had really scary auditory hallucinations and I think I went into a short period of psychosis.\n\nI decided to quit weed again because of that and now I\u2019m 49 days clean. Although I still have all the symptoms from my first bad acid trip a year prior. Everyday I wake up anxious, I have this bad feeling in my chest all day long. The worst thing right now is the depersonalization/derealization, it\u2019s slowly getting better but I have to distract myself so I\u2019m not aware of the nature of reality all the time. I thought a couple weeks after quitting weed I\u2019d feel better but it\u2019s still the same. I feel like I\u2019ve learned this divine truth about the world and I can\u2019t unsee it. My good trips have showed me that it\u2019s all about love and we are all one consciousness experiencing itself and all that jazz, but I\u2019m stuck in this nihilistic view from that one bad trip. I have constant brain fog and my vision feels blurry, like reality is hidden behind a layer of static. The visual snow is still there but I have to consciously try to make it happen, like I can control which direction the snow moves in with my head if that makes sense.\n\nI\u2019m really hoping this fades with time but I\u2019m really scared that it won\u2019t. I want to feel fully grounded in reality and not always thinking that life is pointless because it\u2019s gonna end anyways. I haven\u2019t done any psychs since that bad trip except weed, and I\u2019ve been clean from weed and all other drugs for 49 days. I only smoke nicotine and drink coffee. I feel really alone. I feel like a therapist wouldn\u2019t understand what I\u2019ve experienced unless they have experience with spirituality. Im sitting on a bunch of shrooms and ketamine right now that I haven\u2019t touched in over a year, I feel like a good trip would heal me but im scared of making it worse with the mindset that im in. And believe me I know the beauty psychs can reveal, my first ever trip was literally a religious experience. At one point I felt like I could never be depressed again with the wisdom and knowledge I learned. But yet here I am. Any advice for me?",

We noticed some weird similarities -\n\nWe were both reading the same book and watched the same movie recently ( quite an old movie).\n\nWe were wearing exactly same slippers(I shopped this one from the men's section lol).\n\nOur views were so damn similar about almost anything and everything.\n\nWe visited the same state around the same time and i rarely travel.\n\nAgain, we had to attend a wedding on the exact same dates in a different state.\n\nSimilar childhood experiences and traumas. Very similar.\n\nWhen we first met, we talked about how the loss of a pet affects us and 5 days later my dog passed away. This was the first time I talked about this topic with anybody.\n\nHe went for a trip to a foreign country and before he told me about it, a friend of mine visited the same country and got me a fridge magnet somehow I was thinking about this country when he mentioned that he'll be visiting the same place.\n\nWhen we met he randomly mentioned that he was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism and I was so shocked because I had the same diagnosis 2 years back and our reports were quite similar ( in the range of 5.6).\n\nOur interests are very similar. Like we instantly hit it off and could talk about anything. It was like looking at a mirror. Like he's a guy version of me.\n\nToday I was looking at my gallery and found a picture from 4 years back when I visited college on a random day. I took a picture of the tree that I liked and guess what this same guy is there in the picture and coincidentally he visited the same day as well when both of us passed out years back. And he's looking right at my camera in the picture.\n\nI've always felt like there is some connection and he felt the same. But he's recently been acting very distant so Idk what all this means but somewhere it just freaks me out and makes me believe in something but idk what to make of it.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

I think i\u2019ve heard somewhere that you enter a stream of conciousness when aligning your body in certain positions, i think yoga could be one example. \n\nMy question is that if i for example go to the gym and perform multiple exercises/positions that other people around the world are doing, am i then sharing/tapping in to the collective thoughts of all the people doing the same kinds of movements and exercises? \n\nI\u2019m asking because the last 6 months i\u2019ve taken longer periods away from the gym. And my thoughts are actually better, more pure and aligned with who I am when i stay away from the gym.\nI am missing the kick though, and the feel good hormones that are released. So ocassionally i go back to the gym for an exercise. \nAnd here is the downside and the reason for my post: The thoughts i get the couple of days after weight lifting doesn\u2019t feel like mine. It\u2019s like my catalouge of thoughts changes. I get more lower vibrational thoughts that are far from the thoughts i would like to have. It could be words like, whore, slut and so on. It sucks because I really enjoy the good parts about weight lifting i mentioned above.\n\nDo you think i am onto something here that i tap in to a lower frequency of thoughts? Or is it just my ego growing and the lower vibe thoughts come with it? \n\nI want to contribute to a better place for everyone but would also like to enjoy my experience and pleasure also. This has really divided me and i feel a little lost since working out have really been a big part of my life. \n\nThank you and blessings to you who are reading this.\nMuch love!!",

          "score": 2,
          "author": "WuJi_Dao",
          "content": "The true self, the higher self, the universe, God, Buddha, Allah, or Truth. What do all these terms have in common? They all refer to the existence of our true self. So what exactly is one's true self? Is it this body? Is it this mind? Do we cease to exist when this body dies? Did we ever exist before our bodies were born? \n\n## The Origin of True Self\n\nLet\u2019s go back in time, to the moment before our bodies were born into the world. There were our parents, ancestors, and the world. Let\u2019s keep going back in time to the very beginning, before our parents, ancestors, and all creations in this world were born. What would remain in that place where nothing exists? It\u2019s emptiness, nothing remains. This emptiness is the universe before the universe. It is the alpha and the omega. There is no beginning or end.\n\nAlthough it seems empty and nothing is there, it\u2019s full of energy, and that\u2019s how all creations came into existence. They came from this infinite universe emptiness that is a living existence. When our bodies disappear, they return this emptiness. This infinite universe emptiness has a body and mind. It\u2019s the emptiness and consciousness of the universe, it\u2019s also called Energy and Light, Yin and Yang, Spirit and Soul, holy father and holy spirit, dharmakaya and sambhogakaya.\n\nIn different religions they are called different names. However they all refer to the same existence. This is the mother and father of all creations and the original shape of all existence. Before the coming of Truth, it was the time of material creation, all materials existence are a representation of the emptiness itself, they have never been born and therefore there is no death - no birth, no death. However, when Truth comes as human beings, spiritual creation takes place, and that is the birth of the True Self - in Christianity they call it the holy son, Shiva in Hinduism, and nirmanakaya in Buddhism.\n\nThis is the completion of Trinity: Father, Mother and the Son. Now is this era of Truth, where everyone can be born as their true self along with the world. Then one will eternally never die, such place is Heaven, Paradise and the Land of Truth.\n\n## What Is the False Self?\n\nIf we have a true self, that means we also have a false self. So what is our false self? Our false self is the non-existent persona we\u2019ve created when we were born into the world. As we live in this world, the moment we were born, we inherited **habits** that is also DNA from our parents and ancestors, that\u2019s why we resemble how they act and behave. For example, a person with a European ancestry differs greatly from a person with African American ancestry, but people of same ancestry have similar habits and minds.\n\nOn top of these habits we\u2019ve inherited, we also created our own mind world by copying the world. We form our own belief systems, world view, and conceptions based on our life experiences through our lenses of the world, this is called **karma**. Even twins, who have the same mold, have different minds due to their own experiences and lens of the world. And our **body**, this self that we perceive to be me, it\u2019s also a non-existent and false existence. This is the so-called ego, false self, and an illusionary existence. To sum it up, what the false self is? It is the **karma**, **habits** and **body**. The reason why we are not one with our true self is because we live inside our own mind world that is a copy of the world. Only when we eliminate this mind world and the self entirely, can we live and be born again as our true self without death.\n\n## Why Must I Live As My True Self?\n\nWe are born in this world not just to live as this false existence trapped inside an illusionary world, we must awaken from this non-existent world and be born again to live as our true self. If we are unable to live as our true self, everything else is meaningless. When this body dies, we would truly disappear and die. However, when we get rid of the false self, and born again as our true self, we will live eternally as our true self. That is true happiness, joy, and freedom, which is the ultimate purpose of life. When you are living a life of falseness, you do not feel true fulfillment or happiness. Because all the money, fame, and love are temporary, there is inevitable loss and that is when we feel miserable. But when you pursue becoming your true self, and truly live to your fullest, fulfilling your true purpose in this world, you live as an honor to your true self. You feel complete and truly fulfilled as a human being.\n\nFor me, I am not someone who cries. In my life, I can count how many times I\u2019ve cried with one hand before knowing my true self. However, after realizing who my true self is and why I must live as it, every time, when I think of my true self and the possibility of becoming that, I cannot help but tears come down. Sometimes, they are so intense, that my whole body is crying and shaking, it\u2019s as if my entire soul is yearning for the person I am meant to become. I feel an extreme surge of heat throughout my body along with waves of chills that run through my spine. Every time, when I experience that, I feel like I am completely cleansed, and I am vibrating at a different level, leaving the old self behind, and embracing my new, True Self.\n\nI am longing for my true self, that self of infinite possibilities, the self of all the energy of the world, the self of complete capability and abilities, the self who has conquered his false self, the Self of victory, the Self of love, compassion, magnanimity, the Self of absolute intelligence and wisdom, the Self that is one with the universe and capable of saving the world!  \n\n\nP.S. Original post also features a poem about the true self. But it's quite long, so I won't post everything in one place, if you're interested to read it, leave the comments below.  \n\n\nHere's a snippet:\n\n**A Poem for the True Self**\r  \nTrue Self, where are you?\r  \n\r  \nTrue Self, let me see you.\r  \n\r  \nTrue Self, I've missed you..\r  \n\r  \nTrue Self, I love you so much...\r  \n\r  \nI have never loved before,\n\nTrue Self...",

          "content": "What the title says. I go through periods of almost heart-breaking pain, but don't let that make it sound so horrible. While of course there is suffering and deep pain, I also have faith and love during these trying times and attempt to not resist. But, these life reevaluating pains come with usually very big life changes. As if, all of a sudden, I realize just how wrong everything feels in my life. How *spiritually hurt* and dissatisfied I am with this trajectory, which, until that day of the dark night, I thought was just fine and dandy. Growing awareness if we can call it that.\n\nDuring these times, I don't feel friendships, I feel like nobody I know currently can relate to this. I disconnect with others, as if it's a tender wound which nobody else can feel needs immediate nurturing. I know I might be  completely misperceived opening up and, often, opening up does not feel good, unless to myself/God, alone.\n\nSo here I am again, approaching my late twenties and still dealing with these 'swings.' I'm grateful for the awareness I do have, as I feel this is pain that would simply swallow, engulf, and ultimately drown some others, while I feel like I can stay afloat during the storm.\n\nThis part is maybe irrelevant, but in life, I lack friendships, usually by choice. People want to be my friend, or close to me sometimes, but it's hard to fathom ever feeling deep connection to too many when I go through these times. I've had friendships that I've needed to distance myself from because of a deep need/feeling to do such. What I also want most is a relationship, I've not been great with those, but once more, it's me more than anything. I also have complete faith this will work out. My spirit puts myself through the trenches for a reason. Some reason. I'm not always aware of it, but I know the vision I have for myself is pure, and I'd rather die than to not live a life I love, and I won't settle. I think my dark nights bring me closer to my vision. It'd be a lie to say these never make me question my faith, though.\n\nOr maybe I really don't know anything about what's going on.\n\nAll help, comments, experiences, advice, thoughts, appreciated. I will read every response. It feels so difficult.",

          "content": "So I live in the West but I have a lot of Eastern friends, predominantly from Jewish and Muslim backgrounds. When I speak to Christians and spiritual people about my Muslim friends, I sometimes get the reaction that they are barbarians, they are savages etc etc. \n\nI'm seriously broken.\n\nI am so completely paranoid. I have a Saudi Muslim friend who views the Israel Hamas war from one pov and an Israeli Jewish friend who views it from the other. Both of them think war is not ideal but they also think their side hasn't done anything bad (refusal to believe children have been bombed or women have been assaulted). I have told people that I don't stand for war and now both friends are falling away. I love them, really, I do, so much. I consider both of them family and I can't pick one over the other. They are both angry and I know that the Muslim one doesn't hate all Jews and the Jewish one doesn't hate all Muslims. I seriously think that if they were atheist and less bothered about a piece of land*, they'd make a cute couple, because they are just as funny, creative and clever as each other.\n\nMy family are also annoyed with me as they think I'm a terrorist sympathizer. I didn't ever say that but because I have arguments against why islamically certain things that have been done by extremists are wrong, they think I'm brain-washed. \"Oh look, she's justifying Islam again\". I can't argue against certain family members any longer. An Islamic cleric shouted at a lecture that \"only Allah can judge\" is a stupid thought from the Christians. My auntie argues that that means Muslims are radical and they don't care about child marriage etc because it's not criticised (when it damn well is). I then tell her that some Muslims believe they shouldn't judge others, for example: with the hijab, then I get the argument \"see, so they think anything goes because they can't judge\". Its NOT the SAME. \n\nI just can't. I had a holiday planned for Saudi Arabia this summer but now I'm worried that my family will be upset or worried about me going, especially as jokes have been made about me being a second wife by my Saudi friends. I also think they'll be angry about it. My cousin thinks UAE is like Afghanistan so who knows what she thinks of KSA. My Dad said she is ignorant, which I love \ud83e\udef6\n\nI don't get it. Why can't I just live my life? Why does everyone think I have to pick a team? I'm on the side of f@cking love. What's more is, I want my future family to be a certain way. I know deep down what I believe so I wish my family and some friends would stop pushing me about. I'm starting not to care anymore about what religion my children are, as long as they stand up for what is right,  share with the less fortunate, give the poorest more than the minimum and don't think The Creator is there to be mocked. \n\nI need some warm words. I feel as though I have no one at all. I'm now worried I am going to burn in Hell because I am turning away from Jesus who would tell me to not involve myself in this. The fact of the matter is, I'm so deeply ingrained in a monotheistic mindset which is heavily based in the Torah and Quran.  I know a load of Christians will tell me that I'm an idiot for being friends with non believers or tell me to turn to Jesus but my experience of Christians hasn't been a great one and I can see a lot of holes in certain Christian concepts.These people love me and I love them. Say what you want about their definition of love being impure but they respect me and have been there for me at no financial cost. \n\nI spoke to a secular spiritual Jew a while ago who seems like a very decent person and he asked me if I really had to pick a side. As soon as he said it, I felt a wave of calm wash over me and I felt like crying. I barely know him but it just made me feel so at peace. I'm not asking that any of you tell me this but I'd like to see your perspectives and hear some positive things that won't make me think the world is so divided or harsh.\n\n*I know its important to them but I don't think The Creator would",

He ghosted me twice within that year (first was about 2 weeks and second was about the same I don\u2019t really remember), but he came back both times. We started off being friendly to one another, but got flirty within a few months. We would text and ft so often the last few months of 2020. Then, we kinda grew a part in the early months of 2021, but still stayed in contact. I got in a serious relationship (June 2021-Nov 2023) and had to cut contact with him. Although I truly loved my partner, he would always be in the back of my mind throughout my whole relationship. I added him back a week ago (2 weeks post breakup) because I got a sudden urge to reach out. He mentioned to me he was also in 2 relationships that both lasted 8 months each. My original intentions were just to be friends and catch up, but there is clearly something more that I can\u2019t seem to avoid. Could anyone tell me what my possible connection is with this person? Idk much about soul mates, soul ties, or twin flames, but I just find it so strange that I can\u2019t seem to let this person go when I\u2019ve never even met him.

          "content": "Hi friends,\n\nI am only a few months into my spiritual awakening and am experiencing a bit of a lull in my journey. With the New Moon today, and the opportunity of the new year approaching, I want to really focus in on developing strong habits to support me during these \"dark night\" periods.\n\nFor the most part, I try to meditate every day (however I do sometimes miss it). I've also tried to workout each day (again, sometimes miss, but that's ok). I have been trying to get myself into journaling but I find it extremely difficult which is odd because I found myself to always be a good communicator/love to write/read. \n\nI'm looking for any advice or tips on what worked for you as your daily non-negotiables to keep you on track, or to at least support you on the dark days (because I understand these will inevitably come).\n\nFor journaling, do you focus on 10 points of gratitude, do you use an app with prompts, do you free write whatever comes to mind, etc.?\n\nAnd any other suggestions of daily practices you found helpful in your spiritual journey would be helpful :) I think I am also in my sponge phase and trying to figure out what works best for me so I love learning about what others do!!\n\nThank you :)",

          "content": "Right from my childhood, however busy I may be, I would always feel like spending some day alone, all by myself just being with everything around me. Nothing interested me much like the silence of nature. How everything is happening without much fuss though it is no less than a miracle amazed me. Rising sun, changing seasons, different faces of the moon, variety of life around. I wondered how a human being struggles to live while simple birds and animals carry on life with dignity and harmony. \nI have been meditating for a few years now and it has given me much peace and balance. But recently, I had seen one of my friends doing a meditation called shoonya and it intrigued me so much. I felt a different sense of silence around and within her while meditating. I never felt that I should try another meditation as everything was going fine with my meditation. I immediately enrolled for the program and attended it. When I was initiated into this shoonya meditation which is about 15 minutes, I felt immensely relieved and silent. Everything within me settled and became still. And when I came out of the meditation, I realised the beauty of deep silence and the level of awareness it gives. \n\nI have been practicing shoonya meditation from that day and everyday, I touch that silence. I feel I have taken a step towards my spiritual growth by starting this meditation and hopefully it would deepen with practice. Nothing around me disturbs my peace now and it is such a huge freedom. Sense of balance and acceptance is happening so naturally in my life now. \n\nI now understand well this quote of Sadhguru : \" For those who are on the spiritual path, being alone, keeping a distance from people, and becoming silent are not issues, these are opportunities.\" \n\nThis was totally a different experience for me, so I just felt like sharing.\nAnybody else had such an experience with silence?",

I thought I actually woke up from my nap in these dreams and got up to walk around in them. \nThey were so obviously dreams but for some reason my brain is easily fooled. There were people in my house that would absolutely never be there.\n The first dream, I woke up to one of my friends in my house sleeping on the floor, we hung out a bit in the dream.\nThe second time, \u2018waking up\u2019 on the couch I saw a few people I knew from the past, wasn\u2019t anything crazy, I don\u2019t remember much from the dream other than \u2018waking up\u2019 and then walking around to talk to them. I \u2018woke up\u2019 again in the dream, reality feeling a bit more clearer. \n\nThis dream was even weirder. I got up, walked to the people that were in the kitchen, and KSI was there, I was so excited to meet him that I ended up falling down and making myself look goofy. It was pretty funny. Then a lot of other people gathered around and started eating food, this was clearly a social party. I ended up waking up again on my couch one last time, a little more awake than last time. \n\nI decided to focus on my third eye, while getting up, doing this made me fall over, and I felt all the physical sensations, I felt both my resting body and my other body that was trying walking at the same time. If you\u2019ve ever seen everything everywhere all at once, in that scene where she\u2019s at the tax office and she shifts to her alternate self, it was a bit like that. 2 different bodies. \n\nI felt my body that was resting on the couch, I stopped and relaxed a bit more, and focusing on my third eye area again. It was vibrating until the \u201cpop\u201d feeling happened. This is the first time I ever felt it. I should\u2019ve stayed laying down and meditated a bit longer, but I got up again. The reality I was in felt so clear and real that i thought I was REALLY awake this time, but no, I still ended up waking up on my couch again but for real this time. I wanted to stay in that other reality, it felt so positive and I felt much more powerful. \nHow do I stay in a reality or dream once I\u2019ve shifted to one?",

          "content": "Preface: This post is not to knock on people who do find passion/mission/purpose in their work. What I\u2019m writing is just my own experience and perception of what work means to me now. Also, I\u2019m not trying to avoid work or create an idea of good environment v.s. bad ones. But I wanted to say that seeking a spiritual like fulfillment through a job from worldly benefits does not exist.\n\nHello,\n\nfor 28 years of my life I have been seeking or partly-seeking a dream job that will fulfill my sense of passion/mission/purpose. I've tried many things from cooking, political science, marketing, design and the latest mental health. Once landing a gig in any of these industries, I thought I would reach this hooray moment where I made it. However, I learnt quickly it did not satisfy me as none of these job from a worldly POV could ever be an expression of the infinite or the truth. It dawned on me that I have to become the infinite itself, rather than searching for the right  environment to become the infinite.\n\nThe people working at jobs are often not seeking truth and many of the \u201csuccessful\u201d people I have met were definitely not happy people. A lot of them were not even desiring for a higher consciousness or deeper truth. Also, the work place often is a flawed environment of politics, power trips and ego. I\u2019m not looking down on these people, but from the perspective as a spiritual seeker finding a places that was about love they were not it. I understand there is a tantric perception to all \u201cbad\u201d places, but here I am just showing that most corporate capitalist jobs are not a explicit vigil of truth.\n\nIt seems clear to me now that I have to let go of any notion that there is a perfect job out there for me. The only perfect job for is to investigate what this ego is and to keep on searching for truth. Let God decide my external life whatever it may be and these preferences of how it should be just deludes me. Maybe paradoxically by letting go of my preference of what work to do, for once I may actually find something that I\u2019m okay doing. However, for sure I am now employed to my new spiritual job, which requires not an office or an ashram, but that we merely work on ourselves wholeheartedly. By becoming more in tune with the truth we help the whole world.\n\nTo be honest, I still feel lost right now but I do feel theres more peace in me now that this external passion/mission/purpose idea can die. Now, I can truly enjoy my true passion and mission, which is to go deeper within. If I do go work it will be because it simply is a happening that happens or I need money to live. Keeping it simple and what it should be. Right now, I am still in a bit of the illusion that finding an ashram or a temple to be a monk to be will fullfill me. Maybe I need to just experience the emptiness of that path to so that I can just be fluid into all forms of life. Either way, I\u2019m not gonna force it or place so much of an idea of what to do with my life. It\u2019s all happening as it should be.\n\n**Tl;dr,** Once you see the importance of spirituality, no external job will fulfill your passion, mission or purpose. As 99.99% jobs are not in the business of truth nor are the people there wise people. This obsession for a career, moves into the obsession for truth itself. Your external livelihood is surrendered to the divine will and done for more simple reasons like it is a happening or a means of living.",

And even then, earth itself is so small that a million of them could fit inside the sun.And even the sun is considered mediocre among all the blazing titans that could exist out there.  \n\n\nThen you have some black holes that are so large that their event horizon would encompass our entire solar system!And even that is just an engine that drives entire galaxies. And there are more of them out there than there are grains of sand on all the beaches in the world.  \n\n\nWhich bring us back to you - an insignificant little creature. You are a speck of dust under the universe's fingernails, asking to be noticed. Our entire GALAXY could just \"poof\" out of existence and the universe would keep on going with there hardly being any disturbance, how much do you believe, would a few dozen kilograms of meat and bone be really seen in the universe's eyes?  \n\n\n*Go out for a walk in clear night sky. Look up to the stars and ponder my lesson. And if you understood even the tiniest fraction of what I said, don't bother apologizing to the universe for your impertinence. Because your disrespect was noticed about as much as a cell of bacteria on your skin getting snarky.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for your connection to the universe, you ALWAYS had it. Every single building block that you consist of was made by it. And by the grace of gravity that holds all together, you are grounded to it. By the actions of forces, you are moved by it. By the laws of physics you are granted insight into it. And by the notion of quantum mechanics you are beginning to learn the groundwork underneath it.\n\n**Ergo the question of \"how do I become connected to the universe\" is entirely futile.

If not, then you may know the feeling.\n\nI know that what I seek already is within, but I still search for the art of being others like me.\n\nThinkers like Alan Watts,  \nFeelers like Ram Dass,  \nDrunkards like Charles Bukowski,  \nComposers like Max Richter,  \nPoets like Kahlil Gibran,    \nNovelists like Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2026  \nAnd there must be others.\n\nKafka, Tolkien, Rumi, whom else?\n\nYes, I\u2019m looking for I already have within.  \nYes, I know who is doing the looking.\n\nI guess I wonder to myself, why did God give me such gifts and troubles\u2026 why my intelligence, why my intuition, why my social ineptitude, why my loving family, why my sexual trauma, why my inherent stupidity? Why?\n\nWhy am I here? Why a human? Why now? What is there to gain from this right here and now besides what I already know? Why am I an addict? Why does my heart need this to be posted?\n\nI\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going, but I\u2019m going somewhere. It all must mean something, right? Maybe I\u2019m naive for thinking that. Maybe it\u2019s dumb to think anything means anything at all\u2026 or maybe meaning is inherent to things, or maybe meaning it\u2019s what I make of it\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\n\nIt\u2019s almost Christmas; here in America where I live but from where I\u2019m not, people complain about the language we use. Some say \u201chappy holidays\u201d, some are sneaky and say \u201cmerry Christmas\u201d. It\u2019s all kinda silly, at the end of day the intent is roughly the same.\n\nIt\u2019s all so complicated. Being human is hard, so many expectations. Be this, do that.\n\nEven amongst peers, meaning is often lost in translation\u2026\n\nAnyway\u2026 I wish to you all goodfull seasons, and I hope the message from my heart may come across as sincere.

In other words, you ALLOW that \"everything is perfect\".  \n\r  \nAnd then spend your life trying to rectify it (bhakti yoga) by accepting that you just aren't viewing it from the right angle. Whether its temporal or moral bias, \"I will die, others will, unjustly, too early, love will be wasted, time will be spent cheaply, and so on until: I can't see the overall elegant angle of life, because I am not a spectator, I am participating.\"  \r  \n(This is what Yoga really is)  \n\r  \nYoga really means, a series of exercises to bring you into union with reality or God. \"Yoking\" you into God. The Physical aspect of it is only 1/3 of Yoga. There is Jnana, Bhakti, and \"Asanas\" or poses, these differentiations aren't really important.  It's really embracing the heat of life in order to enjoy the thirst.      It's an honest turning into tribulation in order to cleanse the spirit through adversity.   \n\r  \nWhat Yoga is, is the mastery of the senses in order to view life from an angle that you can appreciate the crystallization and the unfolding of karma from a dimension that is beyond temporal constraints.  Temporal constraints: \"My perspective is limited by my mortality.\"  \n\r  \nIn other words, a crystal made of time and events.  A crystal being an organized collection of atoms in a rhythmic structure.  A civilization.  A religious temple...  A people that harness the power of stars to show the entire universe that order is the rule of the day and not just blind chaos.  \n\r  \nThen, seeing the universe as an elegant expansion of energy that will unfold lawfully, and undoubtedly harmonize into a collective equilibrium based in energy fostered by technology that makes the point of existence to rejoice in its own consciousness. Making something like a \"crystal\" of a civilization.   \n\r  \nSO harmoniously powerful that from afar it shapes star systems into a sign or something.\r  \nSome geometric shape to say that, we have reached so and so point in galactic manipulation. \n\n(Orion is rather symmetrical if you consider the rest of the sky)",

We are also experiencing \u2728free will\u2728\n\nI am sorry to spoil it to you, but we come to earth to experience and learn the most we can which means we did or will incarnate in every continents, every gender, power and also misery. So i will go further now and tell you at some point, you will (or did) experience being a victim of abuse, being a savior of someone but also, being the abuser. Yes, you don't have to accept it but try to understand by lowering your ego on the question. \n\nLet's get back to Adolf H (or any other abuser/evil). I'm not exposing this as a theory, but this is what i think, happened to the guy when he came back in the spirit world\nGot greeted by his guide and quickly taken to that place they \"redirect\" and kinda cleanse the bad energy sticking to his soul. He then had to re see and discuss about it with his guides (long) \nNow, he prob still is reflecting on his life and what he has done and what he learned from it. In his next life, he will most likely have to go trough tough karma. For exemple, it will be his turn to be a victim. (please dont picture the guy face in your head in the spirit world lol) \n\nSo yeah. I get that it's hard to accept. And yes people who made others suffer deserve justice and to rot in a cage for as long as possible (to me at least, i'm not really for the death penalty) \n\nRemember what i said is not everything or the \"absolute\" truth, but this is some sort of agreement from people around the world who seeked answears with mediation, hypnosis",

It's so vitally important to track your dreams. I believe you leave your body when you dream and you travel and visit your spiritual guides, and they leave you with subtle messages in the hints of bits of dreams you might remember. (Not really relevant what I believe, but regardless, dreams are super interesting and wild).  \nI couldn't find an honest and decent site that wasn't ridden with ads to track my dreams easily; so I've done a heap tonne of research, sent lots of questions to enlightened souls to help me with my dream website and have gained an unbelievable amount of knowledge, and thus have created my very own dream meaning explorer!  \nI share this in hopes it will help you on your journey and to also encourage you to keep a little diary of your dreams. Take a few minutes out of your day to note down their potential meanings. Because when you revisit this, you might just find an answer that you couldn't see before, it's really quite something! If you remember anything about a previous dream, give it a looksy!  \nwww.mydreamexplorer.com",

          "content": "\\-Q&A with Swami BV Tripurari  \n\n\nQ. Having had this experience myself, I feel that the description of the universal form (Visvarupa) found in the 11th chapter of Bhagavad-gita is but a metaphor for the intense mystic state that occurs when one ingests a sufficient amount of psilocybin. In religious cultures throughout the ages this chemical substance of plant origin has been used to produce mystical visions. Initially these visions cause great confusion, which corresponds to Arjuna's fear upon first seeing the Visvarupa. Ultimately, this confusion transforms into an intense sense of well-being and enlightenment. Do you have any comments on this?  \n\n\nA. Research shows that visual experiences derived from the use of hallucinogenic drugs vary in relation to one's mental preoccupation. Therefore, persons who use drugs for spiritual purposes will likely have visions corresponding with their particular religious preoccupation. For example, Native Americans and others who practice nature-based religions are said to often experience themselves as animal spirits. Hindus might have visions they imagine (as you did) to be akin to Arjuna's experience of the Visvarupa as described in the Gita, and Christians might perceive their visions as related to the second coming of Christ. Tellingly, persons with no spiritual background or interest whatsoever will hallucinate in terms of their own materialistic interests. Obsessed with the Beatles song Helter Skelter, the drug- induced visions of Charles Manson were of an apocalyptic racial war, one that he personally tried to bring about by murdering innocent people. Nothing at all spiritual about that!  \n\n\nAlthough there are a few Hindu sects that smoke ganja or take hallucinogens in quest of enlightenment, the spiritual mainstream of Hinduism dismisses those who seek to tie hallucinogens to the mystic ideal of the Bhagavad-gita. Indeed, the text clearly points out that Arjuna's vision of the Visvarupa was a blessing from Krsna, the result of his intimate devotion, and had absolutely nothing to do with psilocybin or any other drug. Neither is the use of hallucinogens for spiritual purposes recommended anywhere in the Gita.  \n\n\nUnder the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, one may have visions of Krsna, Buddha, Jesus, or dancing elephants for that matter, but such visions are only temporary creations of the mind. The real Krsna is adhoksaja, beyond the limitations of the mind. His darsana is available to persons like Arjuna, who through their devotion have become his intimate friends. Bhagavad-gita (11.53-54) says that to such great souls Krsna gives the transcendental eyes with which to see him in truth.",

My father was never in the picture but my mom made an \u201ceffort.\u201d However my mother made her bed, and damn near asked to be removed after I understood I can\u2019t keep her around if I want a better life. Cutting my mother off meant losing my brothers which meant no uncles for my daughter. She\u2019s a narcissist and they\u2019re her puppets. It was extremely heartbreaking but I understand everything happens for a reason.\n\nMy husband lacked father as well, but his mother showed true colors as he tried to speak of his childhood with her due to his healing process. He had to let her go, in doing so he lost his sister for the same reason I did my siblings.\n\nWe no longer have anyone and it\u2019s just him and I and our daughter. It wasn\u2019t easy at all, but it was a rebirth for us both. We have to remember it happens for us, not to us.\n\nLoneliness is self love. Letting go of what no longer serves you when you\u2019re on the path of healing.\n\nPlease share your experiences! \u2665\ufe0f sending you all love and positive energy, thanks for reading!",

It's really fascinating to me how they can both contribute to the madness of the ego by the role they play in the industry, but still be aware of how it is all built on an illusion.\n\nFor instance, it's strange how Marilyn Monroe is mostly seen as a sex-symbol and an object of lust, while she was an incredibly sensitive and lucid person. She used the power of illusion to her advantage by inventing a persona. She was smart but used the dumb blonde stereotype in order to get what she wanted. It's as if she was stuck in a sort of spiritual limbo - she understood and used the concept of illusion of the self but still ended up getting hurt by the harsh reality of Hollywood.\n\nAnother example that comes to my mind is Jim Carrey - although that's a very different story from Marilyn's.",

I'd like to think she is sexually free and that brings up a host of things for me, judgement at times and also a longing to be as free. Which normally clashes with my sense of values or morality.  I'm more demi-sexual and having many partners seems to go against my long standing beliefs.  Yet, I'm miserable so, probably time to challenge a lot of this stuff.\n\nDoesn't help that I'm very ashamed by my body and have been nominally rejected much of my life.  \n\nAdd in the trauma wounds of being alone for so long, its hard to let down and explore anything with anyone, but most women, especially more normal won't want to be apart of said healing I imagine. \n\nMy feminine probably needs some work as well not going to lie.

But on September 1st I had a very vivid dream of the man I am \u201cdating\u201d and at this point we had only been seeing each other for about a month. Anyways, he was reading a red Bible to me. He was reading about how God created the world and who for. A song (that isn\u2019t real) started playing in the background and the song went \u201cOnly time will tell If hearts collide Maybe we\u2019ll see the stars Shining bright Baby just hood my hand And I\u2019ll show you why I\u2019ll be forever yours And you\u2019ll be mine.\u201d When I woke up I remember thinking I need to write this down so I saved the whole dream in my notes. \n\n I am not very religious but do believe the universe can guide you through life, but we make our own decisions. Well this red Bible has been on my mind for months now. I have searched everywhere and can not seem to find out if there is a meaning behind it. Can someone please help? Or atleast make a better understanding of this dream?",

I just refuse to judge people based off of when they are born, that cannot be the purpose of zodiac signs.\n\nWhat is your take on them?

Says Bernstein, \"Before you begin the manifestation process, you must take the necessary time to release all your disbelief in your power to be happy.\"\n\nDesiring your dream job? Stop telling yourself that it\u2019s impossible to get, too competitive, you\u2019re not qualified, etc. Cut those limiting beliefs and negative emotions out. Believe that you can get it and that you\u2019ll kill it. That\u2019s your first step.\n\n2. Clarify what you actually want\n\n\u2026and get specific.\n\nIn order to get what you truly desire, you must be crystal clear about what exactly that is. Clarify your intentions so that you know exactly what it is you\u2019re seeking. Bernstein suggests you make a list of precisely what you want because \"this list helps you clarify your intentions and access a vibrant mental picture of what you desire.\" And most important, according to Bernstein, is that you get clear about how you want to feel. When you clarify what you want to feel, you can start to tap into those feelings.\n\nWhat appeals to you about the job? The company atmosphere? The flexible hours? The opportunity to exercise your creativity? Write it all down. Then think about how these aspects will make you feel\u2014fulfilled, proud, entertained? Get specific!\n\n3. Set Aside Actual Time to Imagine Experiencing Reaching Your Goals\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set those clear intention(s), take time each day to soak in the feeling of what you want. This can be done in various ways, but popular ones are meditation and visioning exercises.\n\nThe more you take time to feel the feeling of what you ultimately desire, the closer you will be to attaining it.\n\nCarve time out of each day to take action. Sit in your favorite outdoor spot or walk a quiet path and really envision yourself where you want to be. Soak in the feeling of shaking your future boss\u2019s hand and accepting the position, completing your first big project at the new job, establishing healthy and strong connections with your coworkers, etc.\n\nYou can also try visualization techniques, reciting positive affirmations, and setting aside any negative thoughts that arise in the process.\n\n4. Stop Worrying So Much\n\nBernstein calls this the \"Chill!\" principle. But basically: patience and faith are key.\n\nTo really manifest your wants into reality, it\u2019s crucial to relax and wait without anxiety. Understand that the universe may not be on the same time schedule as you, but that it knows better anyway.\n\n5. Have a little faith\n\n\u201cGetting in the know\u201d is a natural occurrence. Principles one to four will guide you to being in the know\u2014a state where you no longer fear or experience doubt. Instead, you know you\u2019re exactly where you need to be. Says Bernstein, \"When you feel it, you live it\u2014regardless of what is happening on the outside. In time, the universe catches up with your energy and your desires come into form. \"\n\nRemember that it ultimately comes from the inside\u2014if you feel it internally, you can live it, regardless of where you currently are. The universe will catch up eventually as your desires manifest into form.\n\nHave faith in where you are, and remember it\u2019s where you need to be. Your desired job or position will come when it\u2019s meant to. Until then, trust the process.",

          "content": "I don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m about to say will make sense but like, as a kid I\u2019ve always been heavily spiritual and I\u2019ve never been able to make sense of them because I never knew what any of it meant at the time. I\u2019ve always been able to feel everyone\u2019s emotions and at night when I sleep I experience dreams and outer body experiences that it just freaks me out and I never knew what to make of them. My intuition is very strong that it just keeps me from being able to function around other people. And the amount of energy that instills in me is just on another level to me. I describe it as an orb that fluctuates around me and spilling out into the world and that scares me for some reason. \n\nMy dreams scare me because I have an ability to see scenes or snapshots of real life in my dreams and days or months later they play out in real life. For example I remember vividly of having a dream of me being on a school bus with my classmates driving through a country road surrounded by fields of grass, hay and cows with white fences on each side of the road. I never thought anything of it until weeks later I\u2019m on a school bus with my classmates headed to college station for a basketball game and out of no where I see the whole scene play out in front of my eyes. I was so stunned and spooked the rest of the day and got a really bad headache after that happened. I didn\u2019t tell anybody about that because I didn\u2019t wanna be labeled as crazy so I kept it quiet. \n\nThat happened when I was about 15. Since then throughout high school I tried to force myself to not go to sleep simply because of that occurrence. I believe that that\u2019s happened my whole life but with that particular experience I felt that I now became fully aware of what was happening. Becoming aware of what takes place when I sleep made me not want to sleep anymore so I slept less which is a bad thing. \n\nWhen I got to college I discovered weed and vaping and I have become addicted to them to this day. At first it was cool and all until I noticed that the occurrences have died down but not have gone away because I still experience it every once in a while. I feel like me smoking has suppressed the ability but hasn\u2019t terminated it all. It\u2019s almost as if the flames were huge and the smoking has turned it into a slow and small flame. \n\nI fear that if I stopped than my energy and spiritually senses while spike and I\u2019m afraid of it happening because I\u2019m scared and don\u2019t know what to make of it at all. \n\nI looked this up and it came up of precognition. It could be that or deja vu. But I don\u2019t see how it could be deja vu when I see these scenes in my dreams. Could it be something spiritual? Should I not be scared and embrace it? Anyone else feel like this? Or witness it? Hopefully this made sense",

Since I have been an early teenager, I have always been interested in spirituality - knowing what is beyond this world and also the essence of this world. When I was a kid, science was extremely fascinating to me - and continues to this day, that is one of the reasons I chose medicine as my profession and I am happy I made this choice, even though I am not yet a doctor. However, I believe that is something \"more\" to life. I am educated on spiritual principles like God, soul, reincarnation, karma, karmic laws, diseases are in their core manifested in order to teach you a lesson and protect the soul, our world is just a material image and not an absolute reality and so on. Just to clarify, I am happy with who I am and to be alive and healthy.  \n\n\nI am saying all this to explain what my true interest lies in - understanding more of the metaphysical stuff, so to call it.  \n\n\nThe discourse comes with my interests and my age. Since I am a man who does things when I think are important to me *(you know, I don't smoke because it is bad for your health, and also study medicine because not only this will get me far in life, but it is a morally good profession)*, I basically do not take interest in things like sex, relationships, hobbies, cars, anime or most things people my age generally do in their free time. An example is that I do not exercise - yes, in theory it would be good to have a fit body, but given the amount of pain and time I have to invest for something I do not really care about, I don't consider it right. To explain, it is not that I want to do those things and am practicing abstinence, I am genuinely not interested in anything not related to my studying right now. **This has me wondering, is there something wrong with me, or it just people shoving their understandings of what is right to do?**  \nFor example, one of my friends accused me of not going out and trying new things and experiencing life but only loving listening to people's stories about their experiences. He said that it is stupid to have most of you experience come from observation and not through trial and error or something like that. He said I am a bit like a coward for fearing negative experiences, because in his words, there isn't a bad experience, only building of character. I love talking to people, hearing new viewpoints, questioning my beliefs in a constructive discussion... not trying to impress girls or collecting manga etc.   \n\n\nI hope this post would attract the attention of those who have been in my position and know how to traverse their spiritual path through it.

I appreciate you in advance if you read this whole thing. \n\nTw: mentions of religious trauma and ED.\n\nShort background: I was raised strictly Catholic and went to Catholic school until I was 13. I have some religious trauma from childhood and never fully believed in or resonated with Catholicism, so between ages of like 13-20 I didn't believe in anything, and I tried not to think about it due to the difficulties I had with religion in the past. I was also just a rebellious teenager who didn't really care, tbh. I liked the \"fuck you\" of refusing to go to church with my parents.  \n\nCome COVID in 2020, I was feeling so lost and hopeless. I was consumed in my ED, living at home with my parents again after my college was shut down, drinking every night to distract myself. One night I felt called to read, and ended up finding \"Journey of Souls\" by Michael Newton. Reading this book seriously changed everything for me. I stopped having panic attacks when I thought about death, and the entire premise of the book brought me so much comfort. I felt like I finally understand what this thing, \"spirituality,\" was, and how it could help me in my life. It felt like a missing puzzle piece. \n\nI became enamored with metaphysics, spirituality, meditation, all the things. My self esteem improved so much, I've resolved many of my past ED concerns, I reached out for support for my depression, and a lot of good has come from it. I started meditating, studying astrology, doing yoga, collecting crystals, paying attention to my intuition, reading tarot, and really feeling spiritually connected. I felt faithful, hopeful, and sure. \n\nFast forward 4 years. I'm 24 now, just moved across the country, and suddenly I'm starting to question beliefs that I previously felt steadfast in. My mind is starting to take me way deeper than the seemingly simple spiritual principles that I've held onto since 2020. What used to bring me comfort isn't enough. \n\nI feel like all of the work I've put into my spirituality and self improvement is meaningless because it's tied to my own ego. I know that I'm just my soul. My thoughts, personality, mind and physical self are not me. It's started to feel meaningless to try making myself \"feel good,\" through things like dressing up, doing my makeup, even enjoying a nice meal. It feels empty. Like all of these feel good things are just there to feed my ego. The things I used to attach to as my personality and \"who I am\" are disappearing. They're not making sense. \n\nI want to get back to myself, my soul. I don't know what to do to move forward and learn from this. I don't even know if any of this will make sense to anyone who reads it.\n\nIf someone out there has been through something similar I'd love to hear about it. <3",

          "content": "So correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I\u2019ve heard most people in the spiritual community believe that the reason we have this human experience is because our universe decided that it wanted to \u201cexperience itself\u201d in every way, like it wanted to experience suffering and love and everything in-between which is why it created the human experience. But what would make the universe want to do this? I\u2019m not saying that this doesn\u2019t make sense, cause it does, like a quest to find the way back to the light, with all our memories erased during our incarnations etc etc. But I don\u2019t understand why this idea brings peace to you all because to me it is very VERY scary. Think about it for a sec cause for me, it translates to the universe feeling \u201cbored\u201d or \u201clonely\u201d. Like it had a reason to do this. Like the universe was acting out of emotion. Why did it feel the need to do any of this? Why did we need to find the way back to the light if we were there in the first place? That means that the universe was bored/lonely(?) Why couldn\u2019t it just exist or not exist or whatever it was doing?",

Every restaurant i go to lately has excessive, obnoxious amounts of tvs. You can\u2019t even look anywhere without a screen in your face other than the ceiling or floor. I know there have always been tvs in restaurants but the least two years or so it\u2019s absolutely overkill. I don\u2019t get it. And it\u2019s unnerving to say the least. I look around at the other people and everyone seems just fine with it.   2.  Ive been seeing these ads lately for the hemp (?) gummies that supposedly you can choose the mood you want. I believe one of the companies is actually called \u201cMood\u201d.  I\u2019ve always felt kind of indifferent towards drinking and drugs, I drink once in a while and have not really experimented much with pot or anything else and I\u2019m not necessarily against any of it but something about these ads is rubbing me the wrong way.   Both of these things feel kind of horrifying to me. Anyone else have similar thoughts?",

          "score": 5,
          "author": "sasha1695",
          "content": "How do you release trauma?\n\nHello! \n\nIm new to this sub and would love any advice from people with personal experience and hope the wisdom you give me can help others. This is long so there is a TLDR at the bottom \ud83d\udc9c\n\nAside from therapy, medication etc I really think my body has stored so much trauma from my childhood and some unfortunate events in adulthood that my body is never at ease it as always anxious, my mind always ruminates and I find myself always longing for more and never being happy with life. For example I\u2019m going through the worst break up of my life right now (dated for 4 years)  at 28 years old and it feels like I don\u2019t even want to live without him and found myself sobbing, horribly depressed and I even rock back and forth to soothe myself. I genuinely do not want to live a life without him. I realize that my reaction is a bit dramatic but I think there is a source to this and it\u2019s my childhood trauma\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 5 and I lived with my mother, she loved very much from the stories I hear and the notes she wrote me as a baby, but I never got my emotional needs met from her, she spent most of her time in her room. I was lucky if I was fed 3 meals a day and the house was a disgusting mess. But this was normal for me and I didn\u2019t think anything of it. It wasn\u2019t until I was 11 years old that I realized she wasn\u2019t mentally well. She had a mental breakdown and \u201ckidnapped\u201d me, took my phone so I could t contact my dad and drove endlessly for hours telling me that we were in danger and needed to run. I still remember her screams as she banged on the steering wheel of the car cursing out the \u201cdemons\u201d that are attacking us. For whatever reason although I loved my mom and knew she would never hurt me I knew I had to steal my phone back and call the cops/my dad. Once they found us she was officially diagnosed with severe paranoid schizophrenia. I felt immeasurable guilt for being the reason she lost me and ended up in a psyche ward. I rejected her afterwards and almost feared her despite knowing I was the one thing she loved in this world, I know I was young but I blame myself. To this day I have never spoken to her again out of fear, she also decided to move with family in Venezuela and idk where she is and for that I feel guilt too\n\nBut on the bright side, I got to love full-time with my father. My father is sincerely the kindest, funniest, purest soul to touch this earth. He was selfless and always giving to people and making everyone laugh. He was everything I could need after the trauma and he\u2019s was the best dad in the entire world I wouldn\u2019t trade him for anything. Tragically, when I was 16 years old he died suddenly when a drunk driver hit him. This was 10000 times worse than losing my mother and the only thing that could be worse than this loss is me possibly losing a child one day. \n\nThe only \u201cparental\u201d figure left was my stepmom, the woman my dad remarried when I was about 8 years old. Well to be frank I resented her, she blamed me for her relationship problems, she always yelled at me and scolded me and told me I wasn\u2019t good enough. I barely remember any emotional support from her. Even thought I never snuck out or did hardcore drugs in school and was a good egg NOTHING was good enough for her. The tiniest messes I left triggered her OCD and she would show anger to me for the rest of the day. When I grew older she made me feel guilty for not visiting her more and saying I owed her for her taking custody of me and giving me a home when I lost my parents. I will say our relationship is much more normal and she apologized for how she treated me and started trying to change her ways. But that doesn\u2019t change how my view of relationships was forever affected by the 3 of them\n\nI have dealt with anxious attachment styles, constant illnesses and medications and chronic pain as well as chronic depressions, anxiety and passive suicidal thoughts. I know I have to release my trauma from my body, heal my inner child, forgive myself and my parents, forgive God for what he let happen and go through a spiritual awakening to complete my life\u2019s purpose and teach others how to heal their trauma\n\nTLDR: I lost my mother by age 11 due to schizophrenia, my dad by age 16 from an accident, and my stepmother was mean, and gave me no emotional/motherly support. My whole life I have had health issues and mental health issues such as anxiety, depression and finding no fullfilment in life. Aside from therapy and medication I think it\u2019s more powerful to do inner child healing, energy work and shadow work. How do you release trauma from the body?",

He said: \"Behold: In a sacred forest a beautiful parrot was the proud mother of two younglings.\r  \n565. But lo: while still tiny, the two younglings were stolen from the nest by a hunter.\r  \n566. The mother parrot had left her nest unattended to go in search of food; it was then that the hunter \rsnatched the baby parrot\r  \n567. \u201cAfter some days, one of the baby parrots escaped from the hunter.\r  \n568. Even so, he was too far from home to find his mother.\r  \n569. As it happened, he was found by a holy woman.\r  \n570. Lo: she raised that baby parrot as she would her own child.\r  \n571. Yea, the parrot lived his life with her, hearing lovely words, seeing beautiful deed\r  \n572. \u201cRemember that I said there were two baby parrots snatched from their nest by the hunter.\r  \n573. You have now heard what happened to the fortunate one that escaped.\r  \n574. As to the other parrot that did not escape, lo, he lived his life in a cage at the house of the hunter.\r  \n575. In that house, he grew up hearing ugly words, seeing violent deeds.\r  \n576. \u201cWhen each of the stolen parrots was seven years of age, the following event occurred.\r  \n577. Behold: the king of this land, traveling in the forest, was separated from his horse.\r  \n578. For, lo: the horse spooked, having been scared by a snake; the king was thrown to the ground.\r  \n579. Though unharmed by the fall, the king could not retrieve his horse.\r  \n580. Wherefore the king walked to the nearest house, which happened to be the home of the hunter.\r  \n581. As the king approached the home, he was greeted by the words of the parrot that had been raised \rby the hunter.\r  \n582. That parrot, the one that had not escaped the hunter, still lived in the cage.\r  \n583. The parrot, seeing the king approach, parroted the sort of words that he had been raised on.\r  \n584. He squawked: \u2018Beat and rob him! 585. Bind and cage him!\u2019\r  \n586. The king, hearing those words coming from the home of the hunter, turned and ran the other \rdirection, fleeing from the home of the hunter  \n587. \u201cAfter a few miles, the king came to another home in the forest, a cabin surrounded by flowers and a vegetable garden.  \n588. This was the home of the holy woman who had found the parrot that had escaped the hunter.  \n589. The parrot had happily lived with her for seven years, ever since she befriended him upon his escape.  \n590. Behold: though he was not caged and could leave if he wished, he willingly stayed.  \n591. From his perch on the garden fence, the parrot saw the king approach.  \n592. The parrot did what parrots do: he parroted the sort of words that he had been raised on.  \n593. He sang: \u2018An honored guest!  \n594. Welcome to our table!  \n595. Have a warm bath and a glass of our best wine!\u2019  \n596. The king, hearing the warm words of welcome, knocked upon the door of the holy woman.  \n597. Lo: she greeted him and treated him like a king, though she knew not that he was the king of the land.  \n598. \u201cAfter his warm bath and delicious meal of roasted vegetables with a mug of mead, the king revealed his identity to the woman.  \n599. Then he described his experience with the first parrot and its foul words, and compared that to his warm welcome by her sweet parrot.  \n600. The king said, \u2018Thus the old adage is proved true: The upbringing of a beast or man is at least as important as the bloodline.\u2019  \n601. \u201cThe holy woman lent the king her horse so that he could return to his palace.  \n602. A week later, a messenger arrived at the home of the holy woman.  \n603. He gave the woman a string of seven horses, one being the horse she had lent to the king.  \n604. Each horse carried a pouch filled with gold.  \n605. The messenger said, \u2018The horses and gold are a gift from the king, a token of his appreciation.  \n606. He also sends the following message: ' A parrot singing compassionate words is an ambassador of the one parroted!  \n607. Yahshua ended his story to the teens beneath the tree by saying: \u201cAs with parrots, so with children.  \n608. Wherefore, we pray that children with unpleasant parents will do what is possible but not easy,   \nwhich is to cleanse their minds with spiritual water that they may be purified from the parroting of their unpleasant parents.  \n609. Behold: It is much easier for a child of pleasant parents to walk the path of pleasantness when an adult.  \n610. Wherefore 1 say to parents: Lead your children onto the path of pleasantness by walking that path.\"",

          "content": "Hi. I\u2019ve heard many people fondly describe that some people look at them with \u201csparkles\u201d in their eyes. This is meant literally, and is meant affectionately. However I wonder if there\u2019s anything deeper in meaning or significance to this because it seems a bit magical. Can anyone speak to this phenomenon and what it possibly means? And perhaps the phenomenon is not spiritual in nature, and rather a naturally occuring optical phenomenon. ChatGPT told me it\u2019s a byproduct of the eyes dilating with the right amount of moisture. Maybe I\u2019m being irrational and obstinate, however this doesn\u2019t seem satisfactory given the specialness that the sparkles seem to always occur.\n\nJust asking because I\u2019m curious what everyone interprets this to mean.",

          "author": "fahiym",
          "content": "The year was 1997 Atlanta and I was In 7th grade.I had experienced the death of a childhood friend who was only a few years older then me. The death was not easy to process and i was filled with so much Grief and anger that all I did was mope around or fake smiles when people questioned my emotional state. It didn't feel sustainable but also i didn't have the energy to do much else. \nwhile skipping school (now around this time No child left behind was new policy in schools that pretty much meant you could fail all your classes or not show up at all and the school would bump you up to the next grade).I was walking aimlessly through the Art District of downtown and came across a tea house. I was not much for tea but i thought they might have some tasty desserts, they did, i placed my order for a cake looking dessert that i never had and i soon found myself just waiting at a small table observing the wait staff. they'll were very comfortably dressed and took a long time with my order. they'll wore a lot dark blues and orange, not stereotypical monk robes but a mix between something you might wear at the gym and maids outfit. they'll were very strong carrying what could have been 20 cups of tea on one large serving tray. Finally some adult came over and sat in the chair across from me. I was expecting A lecture or a demand regarding why I was not in school. I don't recall what the first question was but i recalled it being so far from my expectation that I smiled. The monk complimented me on my smile but then also remarked that it was sad and that perhaps there was a beautiful story behind it. \nAt the time I took it as a challenge and told the monk the story of my friends death. They were a good A very good listener, their reaction was not one of pity and this was my first time experiencing an adult who was okay with sadness. The monk's name was Azeem and they talked to me for like hour. The monk explained that the tea house was also a monastery, I never heard of the word \"monastery\" before that day and so they also explained it as \"a school for studying your attractions and finding your tribe again\". They invited me to come back and i felt better about the death of friend having been heard out.\nI would keep coming back to Tea house/ monastery for the better part of two years. i learned really cool physical exercises and mental exercises but didn't think of my time there as spiritual, it was healing and I just enjoyed the attention, love and all the learning monks had to offer. i loved being there way better then I liked public school. The monastery had 4 major sets of thoughts Meditation, awakening, dreams and death which the monks and I explored in two hour long conversations that centered my observations in the world and the monk's teachings or \"the order \" or what might be called now \"their wisdom traditions\". it was not always the same monk teaching me but they seem to know the same body of Knowledge.\nI would leave town In 1999 moving with my family to the suburbs of Kernersville. I stay in contact with Azeem by AOL messager and phone calls from a land line. They would also send me letters from time to time to help me  continue my study for years. It was during this time I recognized it as a spiritual practice. it was not a secret but I also didn't go out my way to explain it or talk about it.  \"the order \" or \"their wisdom traditions\" has no name and they actively rejected the idea of putting a name on it, In some ways that made it invisible in my mind, it felt like a hobby with no hashtag. 2004 I graduated from the only other high school in Kernersville and kind of set aside the studying to try to apply what I learned. \ntime skip to 2018. I was visited by Azeem who Invites me to be Initiated into becoming a teacher. I was not really interested In teaching but Azeem did not kedp up with communication technologies. The collective of monks who they traveled around with all shared one cell phone, can you imagine? also they hadn't had a reliable physical address in years. Only because the opportunity might not come back around for years did I volunteer for the initiation. the rights were not easy(and i might explain the ritual some other day) but I become a teacher but with no desire to teach. a year after that wss 2019 The Covid 19 times which gave me some time to reengage with the study and practice. I had a change of heart in 2023 and decided to teach. traditionally teachings works something like: \nI would go out and travel the country side within the geographical boundaries of whatever language I speak \nteach people in exchange for money or whatever basic needs I have. carrying and owning only what I can pack and staying for as long as there are people Interested in the teachings. \nthen at some point If I find a place where a lots of people are interested in in the teachings establish a monastery.\nwhich all sounds cool but would obviously be ridiculous because in America were the last thing we look for in the homeless is Spiritual wisdom.\nHow do I stay true to the spirit of this tradition while adapting it for 2023?\n\nmy first thought was I could be a social media influencer. but the thing about spirituality as i know it and all the noise that you hear on social media about spirituality is context. Its not that they are all wrong or crazy but without careful context to all the woo woo and buzz words associated with spirituality losses so much meaning the quickness and pressure to tell people exactly what they want to hear the keep them engaged.\nfor now I work a full time job at a local business that super flexible with hours. i am essentially I'm their \"monk in residency\" what I do is offer personal sessions to people Interested in spirituality and the order. I take off two hours of work per session and I ask that my students pay my hourly rate for the time I am taking to be with them rather working at the business. I also started a patron to set out some choose content and get support that way. its working for now but if I could teach full time that would be the dream. thanks for reading.",

I even had dreams where I was unable to speak and it was stifling. A tarot reading I got when I was 15 resonated when she said I am not being creative when I should be(badly paraphrasing). I know the rational thing is to just practice and do it thats the only way to get better, but its like if creating art was the only way to express myself, but as an artist I dont have the know how to do certain things, and I dont have the ability to fulfill to the piece I created in my head. Its suffocating. I really want to be good at some kind of creative expression.:(",

My family got into a huge argument causing us to probably not even have Christmas together this year. Then my best friend calls me revealing she has been in a physically abusive relationship that I watched over FaceTime. ( I saw him hitting her calling her slurs) Then the next day my dog got hit by a car and almost died right in front of me. To top it all off now I have to pay my parents back close to $5k for his bills. \n\nI\u2019ve been drinking because I\u2019m usually pro 420 but I don\u2019t want to eat as much and I just can\u2019t be alone with my thoughts anymore. I just feel sad. I just keep thinking I don\u2019t want to be here anymore or how overwhelmed and lonely I feel. I got so drunk last night I puked everywhere and my mom had to come and help me. She gave me a talk telling me I can\u2019t drink anymore and it really scared her. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do I haven\u2019t felt this way in a while I just feel dark almost like I\u2019m there but not really. It feels like everything that could go wrong has. I can\u2019t put a finger on what\u2019s wrong but I just hate myself. I\u2019m not sure how to get out of this dark night of the soul moment. I feel like everything has stopped for me",

I decide to close my eyes, feel, and meditate.\n\n Shortly after a voice appears in my head saying a great spiritual presence has been detected in a tone that seemed like it was directed at someone other than myself, and I felt like I heard the voice through some secret spy equipment. \n\n As I hear this I get goosebumps and start to feel something pulling me toward a vision which is of me super happy and fulfilled.  Then I suddenly \u201cpop out of that vision\u201d to see a pinkish bubble which felt like my energy, and a bluish bubble that felt like the energy of the vision I was seeing. \n\n I saw these as two separate glowing orbs slowly spinning around each other like they were two particles about to collide.  Eventually they started spinning closer and closer together until they became one and in that instant I temporarily forgot what happened and opened my eyes.  After a couple seconds I was able to piece back the events I previously described like you do from a dream in the morning.\n\n  I\u2019m now sitting next to my strained noodles freaking out thinking I\u2019ve gone insane.

All of these skills and perceptions will become vital pillars for experiencing even deeper levels of self and knowledge, further on the journey.\n\n\nAstral travel, which usually lasts around 30 minutes, (or however long the drummer lasts) can be accomplished while laying flat on the back with the bare minimum of three different steps. These steps include a combination of shamanic drumming, being classified as a rhythmic drumming that follows 180- 250 BPM. Holotropic breathing technique as timed inhales and exhales, coming in through the nose and out through the mouth with every breath. Finally and  most importantly the will or the intention of experiencing this state of being. \n\n\nAt the beginning of the holotropic breathing technique while breathing in, one focuses on pushing out the bottom of the stomach to expand the lungs to their full potential. Starting out with ten second inhales and exhales until one is comfortable and is ready to go further. Next, moving to nine second inhales and exhales until one is comfortable and ready to go further, into eight second inhales and exhales. This pattern continues all the way down to two seconds. Then once one is comfortable and is ready to go further, one then starts the same pattern but going back the other way entirely. Slowly leading to a full ten second inhale and exhale. Once one is comfortable with that pattern of breath, they then turn their focus to the physical sensations and to the mind. \n\n\nWhen both the holotropic breathing and the drumming are used together, the particular breathing technique acts as a catalyst to fully involve the physical sensations into the new environment you'll be entering (astral plane). While the drumming acts as a vehicle to carry you there. It is highly recommended that such experiences are done in comfortable environments such as a private room with a bed, or floor cushions where one's work will not be interpreted. Once the drumming is activated and you're at the end of the breathing pattern, one then focuses on the remaining physical sensation and then mind. \n\n\nEven though one goes through the act of \"leaving\" the body, one still has an experience of the bodily senses through this new perspective. However,  while in this new state of being, the sensation of leaving is not a physical action, it is referred to as a sensation of \"astral body sense\". Now after having reached the end of the breathing pattern, one uses both the physical senses and the will of mind to go through the mental action of sitting up from whatever position they were lying in previously. The key being,  without \"actually\" moving your muscles. From this sitting perspective one's attention is fully directed towards experiencing this new position in the room one resides in. As In assuming the physical feeling of naturally being in that position. \n\n\nPresumably one's placement in a room would be on top of a bed or ground roll, in such cases one would then swing both legs off the structure. Again, using both the physical senses and the will of mind to complete this action. Next pause for a second, and take as long as necessary to accept this new position and perspective in the room. Once stable, one then stands up. Again, using both the physical senses and the will of mind to complete this action. It can help to go through each action meticulously for steady embodiment of the senses. The next and final movement is arguably the most important, as one then promptly turns around, to look downwards and accept this new perspective you are certainly experiencing. That this view is real. And the body you are looking at, on that familiar bed, was moments ago all you knew, as it suddenly becomes yours and no longer \"you\".\n\n\nRough visualizations such as simple outlines (corners, edges of furniture) of the room one is attempting the practice in, may make the transforming state of mind and personal perspective easier.  Now one can choose to visualize their position in the room changing slowly as they begin to sit up, from quarter position then slowly to half, however once one is fully seated in the up position there is no longer a need for conscious focus of visualization. The change of perspective and the environment become natural, and very fluid as one adjusts to a different state of being.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations! You're there! Once in such a space, something you will notice among many peculiar things is that the connection is not lost to the body but instead stands permanently glued to the astral form. This connection can manifest in many different ways for different people. In general the connection is usually in the form of a string or rope leaving from the astral forms navel connecting to the physical body. This is an extremely useful tool. As when in such a space, whenever one desires or needs this rope can be used to find your way or bring you immediately to the room of your body and safety.\u00a0 Meeting positive Guides In astral form can be another incredibly useful tool when first traversing the magnitude of the collective unconscious. Additionally when in such a space for assistants to better establish the vividness of the experience, one may interact with their surrounding environment through touch. It helps to really focus on the thing that you are touching and then to really embrace it.\u00a0\n\nThere are many helpful things one can learn in the astral plane. This may include meetings with guides and strong experiences that allow for strong developmental learning. However really all you need is the first three things that were stated such as strong visualization, embodiment of senses, and recognition of soul to progress to the second step of the journey.",

Indeed I realized it this way: I'm addicted to having a very noisy and cloudy mind. Although it doesn't let me be free, at least \"it feels familiar\" which you know, it's all my defense mechanisms care about. \n\nAll of my current toxic patterns involve filling up my head with noise again. Whether it be talking to my most problematic friend and listening to her issues plus giving advice and making up weird stories with her, or theorizing about deep philosophical or psychological questions or theorizing about my friends' minds, or ruminating, or listening to music all day, or studying my own mind, indentifying new patterns and thoughts processes, or daydreaming, etc. It gives me the semi detachment to the present moment I need in order to feel safe. I induce myself to dissociate through thinking \"profound thoughts\" and I truly don't want to let go of this habit. I'm amazed by this. I think of myself as a very intelligent person and place most of my social value in the fact that I'm deep and know stuff. And not only that, but even if I spend months not sharing anything happening in my head, as long as I listen to my own depth (\ud83d\ude2d) I'm fine. \nI realized that in order to find peace, I have to let go of my intellect, my mind in general and anything related to it. I have to be ok with having no thoughts for a whole day.\n\nI'd like to know what happened to you \"intellectuals\" who now spend most of you time living in the present moment head empty no thoughts?

For some more context, I am a college student also very interested in philosophy, particularly philosophy of mind and the mind-body problem. \n\nI find the interaction between the mind-body problem and spirituality fascinating. With my ties to spiritual beliefs and viewpoints of the 'self', I am finding reductionist theories like physicalism very pessimistic. I just struggle to align with these theories of mind.\n\nThis makes me very curious. **What do you spiritually in-tune folk think about the mind-body problem? Which viewpoints do you align with?**  Of course, my question is contingent on the fact you have some knowledge of philosophical theories of mind.\n\nThanks!!!",

          "author": "ChiMeraRa",
          "content": "It all started with the devil rebelling in Heaven. This is like an analogy, it\u2019s an allegory used to describe something profound that presume to provide some background information and shed light onto existence itself.\n\nWhy is there so much suffering and death?\n\nHow could a truly benevolent God allow for us to suffer? God must not be omnipotent. If God is omnipotent and allows us to suffer then God must not be truly benevolent.\n\nIt\u2019s because the devil rebelled and God zapped him that\u2019s what allowed sin to enter the world.\n\nWe are in the middle of a zap\u26a1\ufe0f\n\nThis zap started with The Big Bang \ud83d\udca5 and is ongoing, it\u2019s in the middle of God using omnipotence.\n\nThere were many things that could have happened with this zap, and completely at random, the result settled on a physical existence playing itself out with causalities over time.\n\nThe devil being zapped is what created this world, the result of being zapped by God is that now the evil expressed by the devil coexist and is balanced by the good of God, it was God who zapped after all.\n\nGod zapped the devil because he was bad, but it wasn\u2019t his fault because God allowed for evil to exist in the first place, or at least the option for it.\n\nMeaning God is not fully omnipotent, because an omnipotent God would be able to allow the option of evil to exist AND make it such that evil is good. God cannot reconcile this difference evil has to be evil, it cannot be good.\n\nThat is why God must have mercy upon the devil. If God cannot even make evil good how can the devil be expected to do good?\n\nWho can straighten what God had made crooked?\n- Ecclesiastes 7:13\n\nGod cannot zap the devil too hard, for mercy, it\u2019s not completely the devil\u2019s fault so God trapped the evil of the devil in a world where it is \u201cgood\u201d. That\u2019s why after zapping the devil, the devil wasn\u2019t obliterated, but instead he gets life in prison to be rehabilitated.\n\nWhat better prison for the devil than a world that is good?\n\nFor it is necessary for a good world to exist precisely to house the evil of the devil, who else would have the devil over for tea? Certainly not a bad world.\n\nThe continued existence of suffering and death affirms to me how evil backwards is live, because evil is in the fundamental makeup in the fabric of reality itself, evil lives in us, balanced by the good of God, the world is meant to house the devil.\n\nWe know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one.\n- 1 John 5:19\n\nUltimately, suffering exist so that the devil could live. Again, if God cannot reconcile this then God is not omnipotent, if God is omnipotent and chooses to let us suffer then God is not truly benevolent.\n\nThe foundamental limit is that if you want a good God, then God cannot do everything, if you want a God who can do everything but does not, then that is a bad God.\n\nSo how could a good God continue to allow us to suffer?\n\nIf a shepherd has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray.\n- Matthew 18:10-14\n\nIn trying to save the devil, God deems it necessary to put us at risk again demonstrates God\u2019s limit at reconciling perfectly, the evil within.",

          "content": "Last year I very vividly saw a fat ugly black creature on little legs crawling through the corridor of my house. It was the most vivid kind of entity I\u2019ve ever experienced and I genuinely thought I had gone insane. I\u2019ve always been able to distinguish what is and isn\u2019t really there, but I\u2019ve had minor hallucinations along those lines throughout my life. In retrospect I notice these things I see come as a warning for bad things to come.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken about this in therapy and it\u2019s been mostly a \u2018keep an eye on it\u2019 kind of thing, but I haven\u2019t had symptoms consistent with any kind of disorder.\n\nWhat I found interesting was that a couple days ago the night before my session I had a dream that involved my therapist. I\u2019ve only had dreams of him in the therapy room and it would always be mimicking a session. This time, he was a regular person that I knew in the outside world and he appeared anxious and distressed. Something about him getting sick. \n\nI mentioned this in my session, and then while talking about a topic unrelated I saw something again in the space next to him. A dark figure that vanished as soon as attention was put on it. He noticed my expression changed and asked if I saw something. We talked about it a little and I asked him if he saw it too. I expected him to deflect with a question but after some hesitation he said he saw a flash of something. \n\nMy therapist is a trauma specialist and has expressed openness to the idea of things beyond science. I\u2019ve been seeing him for four years and he\u2019s been pretty unbiased and it\u2019s been difficult to infer what his beliefs are, and I was surprised by his lack of shock. He asked questions and made no implication that it wasn\u2019t real. When I told him that coupled with the dream I think it is a warning of some kind, he said he was taking me seriously.\n\nA part of me was anxious after the session because I was worried this might affect my therapeutic relationship. It almost felt like we were talking as regular people and our session even went overtime. I can\u2019t find any information of people who have had a similar situation and I don\u2019t know what to think of it. He\u2019s not been afraid to point things out as being possible projections of anxiety or an overactive imagination when I\u2019ve talked about seeing things before. I think he really did see something, and he believes me.\n\nRecently I asked for some sort of confirmation that I should pursue spirituality again. It\u2019s strange to have a figure of authority validate something that I\u2019ve been pushing away in my life. Especially one that I don\u2019t picture as being swayed by things that don\u2019t have concrete evidence behind them.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do with this. Am I in any sort of danger if I saw something again? Or am I just a messenger this time. And is this my confirmation that I should start involving myself in spiritual practice again?",

I gave equal air-time to both possibilities, and didn't find either particularly compelling. Discovered a third option which is that physical matter is not fundamental, and that there is a rational way to describe that concept, that also makes a lot of space for things that physical empiricism rules out. Also turns out physical empiricism rests on some assumptions which are logically flawed, resulting in circular reasoning etc.  \nI've since been reading books on physics, philosophy, emergent phenomena, and spirituality.

To give some context - I was an atheist but I became spiritual from last couple of years. I still have my doubts in existence of afterlife, heaven and hell. \n\nIn the dream, I mysteriously learned the exact day I would die. When that day arrived, I was with my cousins, engaging in light-hearted conversation and laughter, despite them knowing that it's my last day on Earth. Contrary to my expectations, I felt no pain as death approached. As my final moments arrived, I experienced the sensation of my soul departing from my body. On a whim, I requested my cousin to play a Pink Floyd song on his mobile. As the song getting started, my soul left my body. \n\nTo my surprise, I found myself in an afterlife, facing a wooden bridge that many souls were crossing. Some seemed very familiar with this path, as if they had traversed it before quite a few times, while others, like me, were in disbelief. Unsure of where to go, I followed the crowd. The bridge led to a staircase descending into a tunnel with a crossroad. The left path appeared to lead to hell, the right, to heaven. Despite our instincts, another first-timer and I chose the left path.\n\nA few steps in, signs proclaimed 'Hell is live now', and a movie was about to be screened, with many seated in anticipation. I spotted a friend, whom I don't particularly liked in real life, already seated (We both are very different people in real life and I made fun of him and he made fun of me. We are still friends due to our common friends). I asked him what the hell was going on here and why we are here.  He smiled and said he just saw his life's movie and now I am going to see mine. \n\nI woke up when movie was just getting started. That is all and now I am scared if all this really means anything or it's just a dream.",

I guess what I am trying to get at is, don't suppress your humanity. It's still a part of you in this physical realm. Take human experiences and use them as lessons. Example; You have been really clumsy one day and it's just been stressful, so you break down and beat yourself up. Ask what has been stressing you, ask why you have been so clumsy, ask why you are beating yourself up. We learn from our mistakes, take what happens as a lesson not as it's immediately something horrible",

It's all just fear mongering, government websites giving 'drugs are bad mkay' approach while completely neglecting the entire cultural/spiritual/medicinal component of psychedelics.  \nHonestly I'm a bit sick of this biased, 1 sided approach to articles on psychedelics.  \nAs I've really gotten to know these medicines, from experiencing some intense stuff like kundalini awakening, rebirth, ego death, and working with different types of shamans around the world, I've got plenty I want to share, and I know the life changing potential of these powerful medicines (as long as they're used correctly).  \nSo here's the link to the article. As always, I would love to hear suggestions, feedback, and ignite some conversation. The feedback of this community is always valuable.

          "content": "Earlier on Thursday, I got some black sage to cleanse my home for the first time. After doing so,  a video came across my feed attached with the numbers 111 and 555 which I\u2019ve seen multiple times that day. To sum up the video, whoever has been sending me negative energy would be clarified through a dream. I had a dream that night (also another reason I got the black sage) I can\u2019t remember much from the dream, but what I can remember was how it ended. A family member was sleeping on my living room couch which I can believe has been sending me negative energy. I also thought I was very hot so I decided to turn the ac down. Apparently, the ac went down from 888 to 777 degrees. I was on the verge of waking up after this dream when I smelled a burning smell and I heard my fianc\u00e9 sit up and ask if something was burning which completely woke me up. We checked to see if anything was burning and concluded that there was no reason for the smell. I explained my dream to him and it really spooked him out. He was concerned as to why I reacted like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Happened to be 2:22 when I\u2019ve decided to ask  Reddit about this. Can anyone help clarify?",

          "content": "So this might sound goofy but I was wondering what this sounds like to anyone or any advice would be great.  \nI ended up moving away from home 4 years ago about an hour away to another state, I ended up getting a job at a small convenience store. A guy came in and I\u2019ve never seen him before, Instantly my heart melted, even seeing him made it feel like fireworks sparked in my head, heart and gut. He gave me a compliment and said he liked my pants (i was wearing black and white striped skinny jeans). I said thank you. He came in a couple times after that and I would blush everytime. We never really spoke too much after that but we would make googly eyes with each other. But I ended up quitting. Never seen him again. Fast forward to a year or so later\u2026 I have this bf and he gets a new job, he gets excited about how his boss is amazing. They\u2019re becoming good friends, saying how the 3 of us have a lot in common, and my bf even said me and him are so much alike it\u2019s weird. Well. I go into his job one day and low and behold\u2026 it\u2019s mysterious convenient store guy! We look at each other like deers in a head light but act like we never met. He knew things about me the way I knew things about him without having a face first because my bf would talk about me to him and vice versa. But every time we look at each other its like I\u2019ve known him for so long. I get the vibes he feels the same way by the way he looks at me. But he\u2019s so similar to the point we ended up having similar childhoods and ended up the same hospital 3 times, i went 3 times, he went 3 times, possibly around the same time as each other, i said I moved away from home an hour away to a different state, he came from the same state not too far away from me. We both grew up in the country, both listen to the same exact music, same interests, we want the same \u201cfuture\u201d. To us even looking alike! Blonde hair. Blue eyes. Certain face structures. Our styles even match. And what are the chances we possibly seen each other as kids, I see him when I was working and now end up moving out here in the same area and him befriending my bf? I see him a lot now and the longer he\u2019s around the more weird and intense it gets. We still barely talk tho despite him being friends with my bf. I feel like we both know the connection is that strong we don\u2019t want anything to happen? But I keep catching him looking at me into my eyes when I\u2019m not looking in a dreamy way. Like he knows me. Like he wants me. The first time i caught him looking at me he just kept staring into my eyes for like 5 seconds and I panicked and looked away. He ended up looking at me again recently in my eyes and when our eyes met he smiled this time but like it brought him satisfaction I guess you could say? Mixed with joy. He smiled like he was looking at me to get me to look at him. I also feel that we are in sync. Ever since all this has happened I\u2019ve also been seeing hella synchronized numbers. Especially 111, 1111, and 555. But also 222, 444. Can someone please tell me, am I crazy or is this meant to happen. There\u2019s been a few other times things have happened with him but I question it like is it him just being nice?? Or does he definitely see and feel it to? \ud83d\ude05. I question if its soulmate/twin flames ?  I also found out we both have life path 11. Im a leo sun, virgo moon, Aquarius rising. He\u2019s a libra, gemini, ??\u2026",

Just that the person and situation played a very large role in my life, and it was a big enough part of my life in terms of time, energy, connection, etc., for my assumption to be that this person was supposed to teach me a lesson, as most significant relationships are supposed to do. (Do I have this right so far?) A psychic actually picked up on the person three years before I met her, name and everything, which I feel would further validate this.\n\nBut some things happened that made me feel like meeting this person just brought me two steps back and one step forward in the life lessons I have learned and where I am headed on my spiritual path. I feel like anything I did learn from the situation once I was on the other side of it were just things that I actually already knew before the situation arose, and had just *un*learned during the situation becuase I thought that it was the right thing to do, then had to learn all over again when things took an unexpected turn. I don't think I came away with anything- in fact, I'm now just trying to re-access what I lost touch with when the situation misled me.\n\nThere are parts of me that were in pain before it happened, and I was trying to seek how to heal them and find a higher path and work towards what my soul wanted as a part of my life's mission. Instead, I just came out of the situation *more* confused and with *less* clarity, and also disheartened and hopeless. I honestly tried my best to do good and be loving and apply everything I had learned in my life up to that point, including what I had obtained from spiritual teachings and therapy and other psychological resources, and then came out on the other side struggling to maintain my spirituality because nothing made sense.\n\nI don't really want advice on what to do- I think I'm mostly just asking the question in the title but then ended up wanting to pour all of that out in the description. But from what I've read, my understanding is that we choose to reincarnate to learn certain lessons and that some of those lessons come to us in the people who play a significant role in our lives. I am stuck right now, because I am struggling to see what I was supposed to take away from this person and this situation. \n\nAre there any books or resources on understanding how all of that works? Or are there any meditations/exercises that could help bring me clarity on the matter? I feel like if I had a better understanding of the entire concept then I might be able to figure out how to approach it.",

But I\u2019m freaked out and can\u2019t stop thinking about it. \n\nMy bf often sleep talks but I\u2019m usually still awake when he does. Every now and then he\u2019ll say things that kind of creep me out, but I know it\u2019s just because he\u2019s dreaming.\n\nHowever the other night I was in a deep sleep and abruptly woke up to him shouting \u201cwhat is that?\u201d My eyes instantly opened the second after he finished saying that and I swear, I saw a huge circular shaped object floating above my head toward the window, and then it was gone. I can\u2019t wrap my head around whether I saw this for real, or if it was somehow part of my dream? But I really believe that I was fully conscious. This object was perfectly circular, very dark, very big, and slowly levitating towards the one window, which is a skylight, that we have in our room. I get scared verrry easily so this startled me. I felt extreme panic seeing this. My bf must have woken up because he agreed with me that he saw something there. The next day I asked him about it and I didn\u2019t mention any details so that I could hear what his perspective was before telling him mine. I literally gasped when he said he DID see something, and described it as a watermelon but shaded dark gray. I\u2019ve been wearing a sleep mask every night since then because I\u2019m freaked out. \n\nI\u2019m hoping someone can help me out here, give me some sort of possible explanation, and hopefully put my mind at ease. Thank you so much",

Till then I had many limitations like I was not able to stay awake after 9.30 pm, was very choosy about food, had less patience with whom I don't like etc. But all of a sudden, I was staying awake as much time as needed for my baby, was able to bear the pain of C Section and sleeplessness, even shit looked cute... Lol. I then realized the power of love where you are ready to drop all your limitations. \n\nLater when I restarted my career as a teacher, I once again grew as a mother when I tried to embrace all my students as my own children. So my inclusiveness has increased and my love has multiplied. \n\nI have observed my cousin who is a home maker and without her, all of my family members can't imagine our life. She creates an ambience where everyone's choices in food, daily routines is carefully accommodated and planned for the day.\nHer devotion towards family is amazing and thus helping her spiritual growth too. I am inspired by her in this aspect.\n\nOf all the days, when I have this sense of involvement and care towards everyone around me both at home and work place is the best day of my life. I go to bed with at most satisfaction on that day. I am trying to keep up this sense every day as much as I can though I keep falling back to older patterns of intolerance. \nAs Sadhguru said: \" The beauty of motherhood is not a certain\u00a0 capability but willingness to include\".\n\nThis sense of motherhood is a powerful process in my spiritual growth.

Usually, it wouldn\u2019t take too much for me to fall for someone, and also to become crippled by desire. This would result in them having a huge power over me. If they responded well and gave me attention, then I would be feeling high. If they would sometimes not show much interest, I would be feeling low. \n\nI\u2019m seeing so many people becoming crippled by love. We let our happiness depend on how someone else behaves. Maybe It\u2019s a deep-rooted condition that we feel constantly inadequate in our hearts, and we try to fill the gap with someone else\u2019s love and attention. And we have so many scars and wounds from previous experiences, because the truth is no one will ever truly keep up fulfilling our neediness. \n\nNow take this quote from the mystic Sadhguru: \n\"What most people call love today is little more than a mutual benefit scheme. Love is an unconditional sweetness of emotion.\" \n\nWhen we get together in relationships. will it not always be a kind of a transaction? I want certain things from my partner. Fx: I want to be looked at with sweet eyes, I want to be challenged emotionally and mentally, I want someone to share my deepest thoughts with, I want someone to go through life and dance with. Even if these things are happening in the most wonderful way, it is still a kind of transaction - Because we depend on someone else to fulfill those needs. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering, has it actually been possible for you to eliminate some of the neediness in your relationships? Like a mother would have love for her small child in a boundless and selfless way, could that kind of love be extended into our relationships, that we simply love our partner and let them be totally free? I have heard of people living in relationships without all the turmoil, and I wonder how it can be done.",

If there is no life energy within us, then we are dead, then there is nothing. The only thing that truly exists is this life energy which is us, but which we don\u2019t realize. We think that we are the body, we are the mind, when in reality we are the Spirit. Therefore, Spirituality is the study of the Spirit. It is being conscious of who we truly are. If we do not follow a life that is Spiritual or rather being that life energy, that Soul or the Atman, then we are living a life of illusion.\r  \n\r  \nWhat is a Spiritual life? A Spiritual life is all about realizing the Spirit, whether it is through meditation or by following a religion. Spirituality is awakening the truth about the Spirit. One may read Spiritual books, one may have a Guru, a Master, one may listen to audios, videos, or browse the net for information, but for one\u2019s Spiritual growth or evolution, one has to go on a quest or a search for Spiritual Enlightenment. One has to transcend the ego and the mind, because it is the ego and the mind that take us away from Spirituality.\r  \n\r  \nPeople don\u2019t know what Spiritualism is and why Spirituality is important, but they want to experience Spiritual awakening, they want to experience self-realization. We don\u2019t know who we are, where we came from and where we will go. We don\u2019t know who God is, where God is, what God is, but we know that God exists, that there is a power we call God. However, how many people really want to know God? How many of us are really making an attempt to know God? Yes, the world talks so much about positive thinking, Spirituality, Spiritual Enlightenment, but do we truly know the meaning of Spiritual Enlightenment?\r  \n\r  \n**What is Spiritual Enlightenment?**\n\n\r  \nSpiritual Enlightenment is the state of realization \u2013 when we realize we are not this body, we are not this mind, we are the divine Spirit, which is also the ultimate goal of life. This liberates us from suffering, from misery and pain. This liberates us from the cycle of death and rebirth, if ever there is. This whole world, this cosmos is nothing more than a cosmic drama. There are over 8 billion people on the stage we call earth, and we all come and go. However, we don\u2019t realize who is managing the show, who is the producer-director of this show.\r  \n\r  \nSpirituality will help us realize the truth. Therefore, we must bring Spirituality into our lives. Spirituality is the only solution to our unhappiness, it is critical for our well-being and peace. We are so caught in this world of illusions that we do not contemplate on the one thing that we must \u2013 the Spirit, the Life Energy, the Atman or the Soul!",

Then who is it that actually takes the Karma to the next birth? Well, it is ME (M+E) the mind and the ego. The ME who was in one body drops the body, at death and is reborn in another body with all the Karmas carried forward. In fact, while alive the body is not the one who really performs the actions. The body acts on direction of the mind and ego \u2013 ME. Therefore, the Karmas should belong to ME; the subtle body, not the physical body.

In energy training, like manifestation, we rely on intent heavily.\n\nThe difference is that we are actually working towards increasing our energy output instead of only using our energy to make something happen and we are also seeing in our mind our energy and feeling it\n\nWhy should I energy train if manifestation still works? Well, if you have a very low level energy (not used to feeling or moving your energy at all), it could take you months to manifest even the smallest thing.\n\nThis is where energy training comes in. From moving energy, you get many things:\n\nyour energy grows stronger leading to faster\n\nyou clear blockages in your body which are interfering with your manifestation\n\nyou become smarter and get a more vivid imagination which are useful\n\nNow that you know some of the benefits of energy training, I must explain some misconceptions and morality on manifestation and intent\n\n\"You manifest whatever happens to you\" This is only half true. If you keep asserting and wanting something bad to happen to you, your intent and the intent of negativity will win and it will happen.\n\nBut you do not actively create reality. That would make no sense, as you would be creating a way different world each time you intent something. Much like in dreams.\n\nIf you think something in a lucid dream it will happen. So in dreams you are actively creating your reality. But not in the real world (the matrix and its various dimensions)\n\n2. \"You must use your chakras to speed up manifestation\" You will achieve a much greater effect from having stronger energy than using your chakras to manifest.\n\nWhen you get strong enough to a point, the energy in the chakras will be less than the energy from your soul. (Primordial energy)\n\n3. \"You can manifest anything you want\" This is a bad thing. If you manifest something bad to happen to someone, it wil not only make your positive energy weaker, but you will start getting negative energy that will corrupt your soul.\n\nThis is why we have concepts like negative intent and positive intent.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, don't try to manifest something that relates to other people like manifesting your dream person or having your ex's car get towed. The other person did not know that you used magic to become their lover and it's very immoral.\n\nYou can still manifest things like someone's health getting better or a friend who is struggling with addiction coming clean. These are examples of using positive intent.\n\nSo.\n\nHow do you level up your energy? Well, I already made a post that explains many techniques of energy training. It's in my profile and on Soulnexus \"Explaining the techniques of energy training\"\n\nI am open to any discussion that relates to energy training or manifestation.\n\nCheers",

          "score": 5,
          "author": "Teeth_Less_Devil",
          "content": "Fear is the emotional reaction that results from a belief in a reality that is highly undesirable or extremely unfamiliar. This reaction is usually a consequence of an unwillingness to examine, inspect and explore a particular interaction or reality \u2013 between the individual and the environment. The unknown is considered frightening, not interesting. Therefore, any unknown causes the individual to put a given meaning of \u201crefusal\u201d to explore. Refusal to achieve a desired outcome or reality. That is, the individual gives up exploring the created outcome or reality, trusting in the belief that they are impossible. As long as there is no giving up on the intention to explore, there is no failure and defeat, or fear. In other words, laziness, the unwillingness to explore an interaction, leads to given meanings that predetermine an emotional response of belief in a reality that is highly undesirable\u2026\r  \n\r  \nThe state \u201cfear\u201d is useful when the individual recognizes that he has it and can reflect on this state. He then becomes a seeker of the cause \u2013 the filter or given meaning leading to this state. Thus, as soon as he discovers the cause that triggers it, he, while exploring that cause, changes the state, and the \u201cfear\u201d dissipates \u2013 it becomes something known and explored. The action of exploring a given state and interaction leads to knowledge of the relevant manifestation or reality. Then the very search for the unknown becomes an inspiration and an opportunity to explore. And the fact that this exploration is vast and inexhaustible causes excitement and trepidation, i.e. happiness.\n\nOnce you understand that it is okay to be afraid, you need to explore its nature and structure, to get to know it, to know what fear is. So you come to the conclusion that it is a messenger who knocks on your door and tells you:\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Hey, I have the desire to draw your attention and make you understand that you have beliefs that are opposite to the direction of the energy of your true self!\r  \n\r  \nLet\u2019s think for a minute: Actually, this is the essence of fear \u2013 energy turned against your true direction of existence, filtered through various beliefs and given meanings. When you filter your energy through beliefs that are in sync with your environment, you are devoted outward from yourself, experiencing joy, seeking filters to adapt to. So when you filter the same energy through beliefs that are not in sync with your parallel reality, you feel it as fear. Fear is an indicator of efforts and choices being made that will lead to results opposite to the desired. So we can take fear as advice from the Source that we are \u2013 what to change in the way we act. For example, to do it the opposite way we have decided it. Another option is to be grateful for the advice, i.e. to be grateful that we are being guided on exactly what to explore \u2013 the fear, the unknown that we will need to further solve the problem: \u201cThank you for drawing my attention to what I need to explore.\u201d\n\nThen the Fear stops hovering around you after it has done its job \u2013 it has directed your attention to something that you need to explore to have the desired result. The recognition of fear invalidates it. The known enemy is no longer an enemy. You know all its weaknesses, shortcomings, and above all \u2013 its way of thinking. This means that it is possible to use it. If it is not against you, then it is with you\u2026 If it was your enemy before, it suddenly becomes a friend who reminds you which things to pay attention to\u2026\r  \n\r  \nThe doorbell rings:\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Yes, who is it\u2026 ?\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 A notice from the fear that you need to sign.\r  \n\r  \nYou open the door.\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Hello, from the courier company \u201cFear\u201d we bring you a message about the belief that will bring you opposite results from the desired. Would you please read the message and sign that it has been delivered to you?\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Oh yes, of course. I read it. Where to sign\u2026 ?\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Here\u2026 Thank you!\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Thank you too! You are welcome any time you have similar information\u2026 I will be online!\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Our company is at your service around the clock. Have a nice day.\r  \n\r  \nIn this way, fear becomes a friend and you use it according to its purpose \u2013 to draw your attention. If you don\u2019t listen and hear the messages, and the deliveries keep arriving, at some point the bill and the messages will pile up, and then fear will get your attention in a much more serious way \u2013 like a tornado that sweeps away your house and sometimes yourself. You just have to choose \u2013 to pretend to be deaf to the messages and not accept them or to accept them with a smile and take the time to examine them.",

When the object merges in its cause, that merger is called pralaya or pran\u0301a\u0301sha [utter destruction]. Since the citta of the Macrocosm grows out of the Macrocosmic Aham, and the Macrocosmic Aham out of the Macrocosmic Mahat, when in pratisain\u032dcara\u2019s introversial movement the [unit] citta merges in the aham and the aham in the mahat, to call it pran\u0301a\u0301sha is quite logical and reasonable. The state of utter destruction of the citta and the aham and the state of all-pervasiveness of the mahat constitute sagun\u0301a\u0301sthiti [the state of transcendentality], or savikalpa sama\u0301dhi [the trance of determinate absorption].\n\nA\u0301tmani mahadpran\u0301a\u0301she nirgun\u0301a\u0301sthitih\nnirvikalpasama\u0301dhih va\u0301.\n\n[When the mahat merges into the A\u0301tman, it is called nirgun\u0301a\u0301sthiti (state of objectlessness) or nirvikalpa sama\u0301dhi (the trance of indeterminate absorption, or total suspension, of the mind)]\n\nPurport: The totally-absorbed state of the mahat, after merging that \u201cI\u201d feeling in the Citishakti [Cognitive Principle] \u2013 rather than doing the sa\u0301dhana\u0301 of installing the mahat in the Macrocosmic Mahat \u2013 is nirgun\u0301a\u0301sthiti [a state of objectlessness] or nirvikalpa sama\u0301dhi [the trance of indeterminate absorption, or total suspension, of the mind]. Due to the absence of any gun\u0301a, this state is called nirgun\u0301a\u0301sthiti, the state of objectlessness. This state is verbally inexpressible because\u2026\n\nTasyasthitih ama\u0301nasikes\u0301u.\n\n[This state (of nirvikalpa sama\u0301dhi) is beyond the mind.]\n\nPurport: This state of objectlessness being beyond the orbit of the mind, it is not mentally apprehensible.\n\nAbha\u0301vottara\u0301nandapratyaya\u0301lambaniirvrttih tasya prama\u0301n\u0301am.\n\n[The lingering bliss which follows this state of vacuity is the proof of that state, the means of firm belief in that state.]\n\nPurport: In the state of wakefulness all three stages of the mind, namely, conscious, subconscious and unconscious, remain active, but the subtler condition is inconspicuous due to the activeness of the cruder condition. While dreaming, the crude or conscious mind remains dormant, the subconscious and the unconscious minds remain active. During sleep, only the unconscious mind remains active. The opinion that the state of sleep is the state of the sense of vacuity is unacceptable to a subtle philosophical judgement, because at that time the works of both the conscious and the subconscious minds are done by the unconscious mind. The real state of vacuity is verily the state of utter destruction of the mind, and so even savikalpa sama\u0301dhi is not a state of vacuity. Only the state of nirvikalpa is the state of vacuity. In this state of absolute vacuity, the spiritual waves of exhilaration that fill the unit entity still continue to flow and trail on for some time even after that state of vacuity, that is, after the mind returns due to unserved sam\u0301ska\u0301ras [the consequential reactive momenta of one\u2019s past deeds]. These very trailing waves of exhilaration and joyous exuberance keep reminding the \u201cmindful\u201d sa\u0301dhaka [intuitional practitioner] that his or her \u201cmindless\u201d state had been one of absolute bliss.\n\n\u00c1nanda S\u00fatram",

          "content": "I had a dream that felt most familiar to me. I was making videos with my friends and they were fantastic. We were having so much fun. At some points I was one of the makers, at other points I was the viewers.\n\nBut at one point I attained lucidity and was watching them from my dream state. God was there and was telling me this was Heaven, and it existed side by side with this reality. \n\nAfter telling me that, I became one of the makers again and was watching this one video where I had given this woman creative authority and she had made her own music video with us. I remember watching it and not liking her that much, and then I woke up.\n\nAt first I was confused, frustrated, and sad. Those were beautiful times, and I was vaguely aware that they were taken from me, but God told me that that wasn't the point. The point of the dream, and why he showed it to me was because it was a hint. There was significance in the last video, and that's why I was here in this reality. But I could go back.\n\nAfter some thinking I realized I must've done something to her. Maybe I killed her out of spite, or maybe it was something as simple as telling her I didn't want her to be in our videos anymore. I made her feel like there was something wrong with her, or that she wasn't good enough.\n\nCoincidentally, that's what I've struggled with my whole life. Not only telling others they weren't good enough and cutting them out, but telling myself that as well. I always felt like I was inadequate, that there was something wrong with me or that people wouldn't like me. I realized that must've been my karma. I put those feelings on her, so now I struggled with those feelings too.\n\nIn this life and on my path to healing, I learned not to care what other people thought about me, not to care about fame or validation. I learned that I was special and built just the way God intended. So in that light, so was everyone else. Everyone has their place and the divine right to express themselves and be who God built us to be. \n\nI'm not saying this is the lesson we must all learn, but the hint was that WHAT I HAD STRUGGLED WITH THE MOST is what I put someone else through and that's why I'm here. God said I can go back whenever I want, I just had to learn this lesson. \n\nAnd because everyone is special and deserves a place in Heaven, I'm sharing this with all of you. You are all special and I want to see every single one of you when I get back to Heaven. Let's go together, and enjoy God's beautiful creation for all eternity. I was given a hint on how to get back, so now I'm sharing this hint too. No matter what you're all struggling with, we can go back. We WILL go back. \n\nWhat do you struggle with the most? What's been the biggest theme in your life? Consider maybe your lesson isn't only overcoming that in yourself, but overcoming it in others as well. Our karma is what brought us here, and we suffer as we have made others suffer. For me, the lesson was realizing everyone is special and has something valuable to offer. What's your lesson?",

In 2021, a close family member of mine passed after 3 weeks of struggling in the hospital- i lost my voice the day after he died and was completely silent at his wake and funeral .. I remember bringing a notebook bc i had to write to communicate with others - and now, it dawned on me that here I am with no voice again, and that I lost it the evening of my cousins funeral. \n\nMy first thought is throat chakra .. could it be things left unsaid , or not fully expressing myself or allowing myself to grieve/ mourn?

I used to feel like I was pretty intelligent and now I feel dumb. But what has been frustrating is over the last year I\u2019ve had some major awakenings in my spiritual life - life changing experiences that have inspired new ways of living and things I want to learn about and grow and do, but often feel blocked by an inability to understand fully or retain information. Sometimes I feel incapable of even the smallest things. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if I have a specific question. Maybe looking for others\u2019 experiences. Like did this happen for a reason to force me to slow down from my original busy career and mainstream life? Is there a purpose to any of this physical trauma? How can I overcome it, if it\u2019s something to overcome? Or maybe just how can I embrace it yet still immerse myself in a life that inspires me to learn and grow? \u2728",

I did some research and it seems that i stumbled upon the \"akashic records\" by accident. If someone were to tell me about this place state before it happened to me I never would have believed them. I could see the skin of the universe get pulled back and I could see the geometrical shapes that make up the universe I could see calculus and how the world works. I lived multiple separate time lines of life based off a certain choice point point in my life. I could see the probabilities of everything ever things never invented etc. The best way can explain it was saw the entire universe through the eyes of God for 45 minutes. I was amazed at the different things I saw and experienced. After this trip when I woke up it was like in the movies when everything is dark then they suddenly open their eyes and they're in the middle of the woods or something but I was on my couch lol. After opening my eyes I felt like everything is not how it was before, everything just seemed new like I was seeing the world from a different perspective.\nLater in the day just pondering what had happened I discovered that I could practically go to this place on command I felt like I could just match the wavelength just thinking about it. However my trips Since then I haven't been able to access nearly as much information. Can someone just kinda explain it to me i feel like I have nobody to relate with my friends are all calling me crazy. I just can't believ that a place so terrifingly beautiful exists. I just feel like the whole world is a simulation now.",

A coincidence? Even though I believe in coincidences, I find it all very strange. There may be a spiritual meaning behind this...

          "content": "This is an idea I\u2019ve been having for a while on the passage of time and its contingency. I wrote it in the form of an argument/discussion, because it stemmed from one I had with my dad a couple years back and only just formed a solid argument for it. Lmk what you think. \n\n- Time is not a constant. It is experienced by everyone differently. \n- No, it\u2019s the same. A second is a second no matter what\u2014see a timer. \n- But a second is longer for someone under stress typically. When you\u2019re having sex, a second is gone like it didn\u2019t even come at all\u2014you\u2019re experiencing pure ecstasy. \n- But, the timer says it\u2019s constant. Someone having sex for 20 minutes that feels like no more than 5 is still experiencing the same 20 minutes as a person that is studying who feels that it was no shorter than an hour. \n- Yes, but if each person feels like time is different\u2014if the perception of the duration of time is contingent on the person\u2014is time as we know it, as we see it pass in on a clock, not only guidelines? Our perception is what\u2019s true. For example, you and your friend are working on a group project together. You and he are both researching, but you are being extra productive. You\u2019re finding with ease the articles that best fit the Project. Things are going well for you. Whereas for him, he\u2019s lost. He\u2019s trying to figure out where to find articles. Neither of you have a clock or phone nearby. At the end of the two hours that you both cut out of your days to meet and work on the project, you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s over already, \u201cit felt like 30 minutes,\u201d you exclaim. Whereas he felt as if it lasted 3 or 4 hours. Both of you had the same experience, sitting next to each other. One was going with the flow of time, and one was going against it, fighting its constant current. Thus, only your perception is important\u2014what does it mean to objectively last 2 hours when 2 hours for one person feels longer than 2 hours for the other person. I\u2019m not saying to label the amount of time spent based on how long you felt it last. I\u2019m simply saying time as we know it is contingent on our perception. It is not as constant as we think. My perception of not only time but also of the world is completely different from yours and ours from anyone else\u2019s. Once you realize this it becomes easier to accept that time and many other aspects pass differently. This can be applied to a bigger scale\u2014the older people grow, the faster time passes. Thus, sure time as on a clock is the same, the perception is what we know and it is the only way we can experience it. This, that is what\u2019s important to the individual. I believe we think of time incorrectly. We think of it in a limited space. We put it in a box and haven\u2019t questioned it since. But there\u2019s more to understand about the passage of time I believe.",

If yes, how does it occur in the first place and what does the treatment look like?\n\nAfter plenty of research on this topic and encountering some really difficult people who suffer from Narcissistic Personality Disorder and similar, I arrived at a conclusion that they're possesed by demonic spirits. And I'm not alone to arrive at this conclusion, there are countless experts who agree. Not just that, there are even some ancient references to it that fit the description.\n\nNarcissists know they're doing wrong and derive sadistic pleasure from hurting kind hearted people. There's an utter lack of empathy and self awareness, and complete inner disbelief in a higher self.\n\nVery rarely, they feel the need for seeking help with their destructive behaviours, but they also desperately want to attack the same person that comes to help them, because of the strong assumption that they can't be wrong. If you want to propose the trauma angle to explain their behaviour, there's hardly any success with therapy, and in the extremely rare event that they agree to try it, they never miss this golden opportunity to traumatize and gaslight the victim further. \n\nThey're as close to the manifestations of evil in human form as we can get. In fact, in the field of psychology, Narcissism, Machiavellinism and Psychopathy forms the Dark Triad. These people would love to destroy you and won't bat an eye before going out to get their next victim.\n\nOf course, most here will say, \"look at the divine in them\". I tried. I really did. Even most holy saints in the history did. You know what happened? I hope you do. The story never ends well. Not a very good idea! Let's learn from it.\n\nSo, is there a cure for spiritual diseases like these? If yes, how does it occur in the first place and what does the treatment look like?",

          "content": "I want to share a story and just hear others thoughts and insight, and if anyone has had a similar experience. \n\nLast night I was opening up to my partner about some of my recent insights and spiritual experiences. A lot of what I was telling him, I had never said out loud or even put directly into words so it was the first time I was piecing together some of these things in a more tangible way. Anyway, I started talking about an experience where I felt in complete alignment with my higher self (for context, I have been in conversation with my HS for a couple years) and had this moment where I felt as if my HS, for the first time, was directly communicating back with me. I felt like I was lifted up and merged into this one high state of being rather than being a separate consciousness below my higher self. I could sense how this consciousness watches over me and the love it has for me. It felt like an embrace and a deep knowing that she (myself) is here to protect and guide me and all that. It felt wonderful and insightful\u2026 then just a couple months ago, I had a similar experience with Mother Gaia. I have also been in conversation with her regularly for some time and one night, it felt like she came directly to me and showed herself. Not visually, but I could feel her presence and she basically let me know that she is here as my protector and will also serve as a guide to me. It felt like this wave of blissful, peaceful knowing that washed over me and illuminated me from the inside out. That was a magical moment as well and I felt this beautiful emotion that I had never experienced before. Anyway, I pretty much have just carried those experiences with me since then.\n\nIn the last couple weeks I have felt like my spiritual journey is on the cusp of a big breakthrough and a flood of insight. I was talking to my partner about some of it but had no intention of telling him I have been visited by or interacted with my higher self and Mother Gaia because there are some things I guess I\u2019m just not ready to say out loud yet, or haven\u2019t even fully grasped myself yet. But before I knew it, this wave came over me and I was telling him the exact stories of what happened. While I was telling him, I felt like I was out of it and almost like I was drunk or high. Just a buzzy out of it feeling. It felt like I was listening to someone else tell him this story while I was just sitting there like I wasn\u2019t ready to talk about that??? I could hear myself saying these things but in my mind I was also like why am I saying this right now, where is this coming from? I told both stories start to finish and had tears streaming down my face as I did. The moment I finished, I looked at him and just said \u201cI feel like I need to cry\u201d and then just started bawling my eyes out for a couple minutes. He came over to me and just let me cry it out with him. It felt like that cry was just a direct way for some energy to exit my body and once it was gone I just started laughing for a second and then I looked at him and was like \u201cI have no idea what just happened, I have no idea where any of that came from.\u201d And that was it. Afterwards I felt kind of shaken up but not in a bad way, kind of just like I had just done something really intense and that required a lot of exertion. \nThoughts?",

I don't want to go into details, who knows this case will know, who doesn't know - don't look it up. I cry general tears for her which is pointless since she's long dead and nothing bad is happening to her anymore. But what am i supposed to believe in here ? The soul chose it? I haven't even read the full list she had to experience and im already sick and devastated, but to choose this ? Some people even say it's karma or past life build up. But i don't see it as something fair at all. She was just a kid, why would a kid suffer for past mistakes, it doesn't make sense so I ain't buying that karma stuff. It's the same all-present question about \"good\" and \"bad\" things happening to the people. \"Just to experience it\" it's so brutal, life is so bruta.  \n\n\n There maybe some higher order i can't comprehend with my mind yet but i would still say it's brutal. I'm not even mad at people that did this, but at the situation in whole. How can world that has nebulas, galaxies and stars can have this. We essentially live on this planet and we have to kill other animals for food. This is very brutal but a way of life and Junko's story is part of this life too. But I personally don't have enough emotional experience to process it and come to any resolution. I don't even want explanation for evil, i would want explanation for brutality. Where it comes from, why it happens. It wasn't for survival for sure. Animals don't do tortures, they don't take pleasure in victim's pain. Is it same brutality as black holes eating off entire galaxies without caring, demolishing all the light. But it's not the same since they don't experience emotions, they don't feel pain. Then why the (excuse my language) FUK WE DO THIS ? There's no answer to that. I hope ultimately the love will shine through.",

Serenity is that state when there is no anxiety. It is a state of tranquility. Basically, most of us are caught in thought, when there is thought, thoughts become the mind and steal our peace. We need the state of thoughtlessness that state of consciousness. This is true meaning of peace, because when there is no mind or no thoughts, then our life becomes like a still lake, and there are no ripples or waves, that robs the tranquility, the serenity of the still lake. So, the mind and thoughts create ripples in our head. And we lose our peace and tranquility.",

In reality where is the mind, you cannot find. And the mind doesn't want us to comprehend death, because it appears to be out of ignorance. It creates that state of ignorance, where it makes us a slave till we reach our grave. Therefore, if we comprehend death, then we will realize there is no mind. There is no mind and ego ME, there will be no karma, there will be no rebirth. Therefore, the mind confuses us. It creates confusion so we don't reach the conclusion. And death remains a mystery. So, we see through history, and we just live and die and we are reborn and this goes on and on. No doubt death happens to everyone. But the mind creates such an illusion about death, that we think that we die, when in reality we are immortal Souls.",

          "author": "lilyd322",
          "content": "I believe the way most situations play out is that there\u2019s a reason behind them, but you don\u2019t know why until you\u2019ve gone through the pain of it (excluding abuse, etc.) for example, a heartbreak, or a rejection.\n\nI\u2019m going through a situation and I don\u2019t know what to make of it and I wanted to know if there\u2019s any sort of spiritual connotation to it.\n\n\n**BACKSTORY:**\n\nI met a man 2.5 years ago in the city I used to live in. We went on a couple dates and I was smitten. He was there a few weeks but going back to the country where he lives (where I have family, but I hadn\u2019t visited in a while). 1.5 year later, I ended up moving back to the country, and we reconnected as friends. He was the one who reached out. I didn\u2019t move because of him, life just somehow led me there. I had resigned from my job and I wanted to be closer to my family.\n\nI had always admired him but it didn\u2019t seem like he wanted anything more and so we hung out as friends. He did casually ask me to hang out together on New Year\u2019s last December but at that time I had already met someone so I said no. Anyway a few months later (when it had been a while since my other connection ended) we rekindled again and talked more and more, ended up in a romantic connection, during that time he became more emotionally available, opened up, and we even briefly talked one night about how strange it is that we met in another country and now live in the same one and how it felt like fate. Even the people we know, it\u2019s seriously strange and unlikely that we\u2019d have this mutual connection but we found out that his best friend and my brother were really good friends and basically my family trusted him even more due to this mutual family friend. Everything literally just felt like a destined \u201csmall world moment.\u201d\n\nBut he was still on his journey to figure out his own life and couldn\u2019t give me what I needed emotionally, so we parted ways. He\u2019s going through a lot of family situations too, so I understand, and my intuition says he cares about me and he knows how I feel too because I reached out to him, but he has a massive wall up. I\u2019m not forcing the wall down and I have surrendered but this is my question\u2026\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\nWhat is this journey for? Why do we meet people who we potentially fall in love with only to end up not even being able to be together because of wrong timing? It was wrong time timing 2.5 years ago, it was wrong timing a year ago, and it was wrong timing again a few months ago.\n\nI know sometimes these experiences don\u2019t have \u201cwhy\u2019s\u201d but it\u2019s been driving me crazy to want an explanation because I think it\u2019ll make me feel better if I had an explanation as to why some things feel like they\u2019re made for you and then you can\u2019t even have them. You know?\n\nCan anyone relate to the feeling of just being lost over a similar situation, wondering why, and trying to make sense of the journey?",

          "content": "Do you ever notice how people these days rely so heavily on finding meaning in the happenings of their lives?  \nI dont mean finding the meaning of life. That is an honorable pursuit.  \nI mean finding meaning in astrology, angel numbers, cosmic events, religion and all forms of spirituality?  \nPeople think the time and place of which they were born makes any  difference in their personality and behavior. It\u2019s a pseudoscience and it has never been based on anything real.   \nWe think there is always some cosmic intervention that landed us where we are.   \n\u201cIt was the universe!\u201d  \n\u201cThe stars aligned!\u201d  \n\u201cI manifested this!\u201d  \n\u201cMercury is in retrograde!\u201d  \nWhen something good happens, we think it was fate.   \nWhen something bad happens, we think it was karma.   \nBut really, the only two reasons for anything happening to you is logic and yourself.   \nYour grandma had a heart attack and died the same day your cat gave birth to a litter of kittens, only one of which was female? That\u2019s just human nature. Old people die. And cats are just born, they don\u2019t give a damn when. Biology, Logic.   \nEven though you weren\u2019t planning on going to a bar one day you walked into a bar because you heard your favorite song playing. You got a drink and started talking to someone at the bar that has your dream job. You leave the bar with an interview for your dream job the next day. You. You made that happen. Not because of divine intervention. Because you just decided to go to a bar. Because the guy working there happen to play a song on the speaker. Because that company with your dream job happen to be hiring.   \nThe reason for you standing where you are right this moment is because of all your decisions and behavior since you were born.   \nThe reason for all the bad and all the good is just you. Youre decisions on the most miniscule if things have a lasting impact on the world.   \nIsn\u2019t that easy enough to grasp? Why are people so desperate to give meaning to everything? Why can\u2019t we accept that we just exist in this one realm?  \n",

But it's also because I still struggle a lot of my Self-Agency, discipline and many ego-centrist issues.\n\nI'm 24 btw, I see my friends and colleagues succeeding in their careers, working hard on their long term goals and relationships. And I'm feeling stuck, materially. Feeling a little too comfortable with just being like a still plant, making enough money to just pay my rent and eat and it's kinda scary because I'm aware of how I'm gaslighting myself into believing it's part of the process, but I'm stagnant it feels like prison and I'm definitely not living at my highest passion. I'm also procrastinating career decisions I need to make as soon as possible, but I kinda don't care enough. For me reading about psychology, esoterism and quantum physics feels good but also this focus on \"self-improvement\" now is feeling like a scape or a burden.\n\nI need to bring me back to society's demands but I don't really seem to care if I don't come back.

          "content": "For my part, so far, I have not found any. None more than \"the sensation\" of deciding my actions, but the sensation is not falsifiable, nor is it totally objective, that is, it can make us believe that the sun revolves around the earth. EDIT: Well actually I remember one, which I don't know if it's an argument: Qualia.\n\nSCIENTIFIC DETERMINISM: Current science tells us of a beginning, at least of this universe, of a great 'explosion' or expansion, which we can call the first cause (at least of this universe). Cause of the progressive development of light, stars, matter. A chain of events, cause-consequence, similar to a game of billiards. And therefore it is a cause-effect chain of energy and matter (phenomena widely studied by classical physics), if we could know the exact speed and location of billiard ball 1 (continuing with the analogy) impacting ball 2, which will cause The resulting speed of the total number of balls being moved by chain impacts, and the final resulting result of the location of all the balls in space, we could know the entire cause-effect and result chain of everything in the universe. Therefore, all the information about the course and result of ball 2 (present) was in ball 1 (past), everything would already be written, there would be no other margin, everything within the plans of the whole, including emotions, decisions, and emotions. that dictate decisions.Because our decisions derive from the conditions and cause (cause-consequence) of neurotransmitters in our brain, which derives from our body, which derives from some environmental conditions that have occurred, which derive from the development of matter in the stars given the first cause.\n\nNeither could quantum physics: Nor could quantum physics throw a definitive rope to those of us who seek a light of freedom. It is true that from the quantum approach the exact speed and location of a particle cannot be known at the same time (uncertainty principle). Further studying the most elementary so far, the wave, this also turns out to be deterministic.\n\nTHE ARGUMENT FROM NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES: Cases have been reported where the patient who does not have cardiac activity recorded, and with partial brain activity, manages to know the location and details of who and what is in his room, without this being conscious. This could be understood as a strong argument, or refutation of materialism. The mind or soul would not be exclusively linked to the brain, matter. But, (and this is a personal deduction) if we observe photographs of the aura in people or things, we would have a manifestation of what our emotions and thought process would look like, which constitutes the soul. Therefore, if person A is at a point in space 1, his aura or soul cannot be in space 2. From this I can draw a first conclusion, that the soul is matter, subtle. It is subtle matter located in time and space, in another state.Personal refutation: I am not an atheist and I believe that we all have soul and spirit, and that these make up, are part of BEING in capital letters or THE WHOLE, just like the leaf of a tree, the tree in its entirety. What happens is that this tree is also made up of a material dimension (multiverse/s), and a spiritual or soulful dimension. And since the soul is subtle matter... the disembodied, the soul about to leave the body... goes towards the subtle, the soulic dimension of the ALL, of the tree. In the material dimension, just as a leaf falls to the ground when it perishes to nourish the soil, the soul would ascend to nourish the clouds that provide irrigation to the tree. Being in lowercase letters experiences part of the dimensions of BEING in uppercase letters. The tree being part of a greater whole that is still material. In conclusion: upon disincarnation, our subtle matter ascends to its port, the subtle matter part of the BEING. Like a cell that breaks down and forms the being in the extracellular matrix of a person.\n\nMy personal ray of light:\n\nAnd yes, I have to refer to the feeling, although as I said I don't know if it is a final argument. To the feeling of being alive, the conscious experience of seeing the flower in an adagio. I could never know exactly what an astronaut feels when seeing the Earth from the stratosphere, even if he took all the time to explain it to me. A picture would say a thousand words. Nor could a person, who lived his entire life in a black and white room, perceive the color blue, even if he strives to understand it and studies it theoretically. Blue is 'qualia'.\n\nBut:...but... This raises a division between feeling and knowledge. ...But... What if feeling is a format of knowledge?Because I feel like it's cold, I know I should put on a coat. Or because I know it's cold, I feel like I should put on a coat to feel comfortable. Inside the black and white room, an alien could give us ALL the 'knowledge', in all its formats, and make us experience the color red without leaving the room. THE matrix would continue to be matrix, the sensations: knowable......\n\nayudasdasd",

I've also noticed a dark spot in the centre of my vision that sometimes has a blueish halo around it and emits a golden energy from its outside occasionally it grows in size which startles me. The most recent thing I noticed was this morning in the shower there were many specks of bright light that disappeared when I looked at them directly or moved with my vision. ive been an atheist my whole life and I dont have anyone to talk about this with im worried im going crazy sorry if this is confusing to read im writing it in a rush",

So I asked him about it. After talking to him, there was this phase where he'd stare at me and I'd know he's looking at me and again when I looked at him, and move my gaze, he'd still look at me. Before we started talking, I felt as if he's been observing me cuz there were moments where in I felt him being close or in proximity to me. Not because he wanted to, but cause of the situations around us. After we spoke, he was intuitive enough to find that I've anxiety issues and he told me a lil bit about his past. He helped me with studies and he asked my help in meditation. So, I've been helping him with meditation and with spirituality and his mental health for 5 months now almost. He's going through a heartbreak. And I've been helping him through that as well. Cause when I got to know about what's he's been through, I kept my feelings aside and just wanted to be there for him. No matter whatever happened. There was this part in me which wanted to protect him at all costs from everything negative. Sometimes I feel as if maybe me and him have a soul contract or not. Cause there have been moments where we couldn't see each other. It's been 4 months since I saw him. My friends saw him but I didn't. Maybe it happened cuz the timing never aligned. Or maybe the universe never wanted us to see each other. Today he was in my college and I was there too but I never got to see him. He told me about it once I was back in my home. Is this a universe's way of saying that it's not meant to happen? \n\nPS:  I was thinking of giving him an evil eye bracelet, since he's leaving on the weekend.",

          "content": "**THIS IS A LONG READ!!!**\n\nI know the answer to this. I just want to share my story for those who may want to hear it. This is a long read about a coincidence I experienced that I know most would look at as a sign. I don\u2019t look at it that way since I know of all the \u201cprepwork\u201d it took to get there. Regardless, I feel this story may resonate with someone and/or teach them something or help them understand something about themselves, which is enough for me to post it. \n\n**Background: The Setup**\nEach variable here must be EXACTLY AS IS or else everything else is ruined. If you don\u2019t understand the butterfly effect, just do a quick google search.\n\nBack in August during a hypomaniac episode (therefore I need to have bipolar II), I impulsively got myself into college. The stars really aligned for that, which is its own story, but not the point. \n\nBack in May? I started smoking weed. I always buy off my friend who lives a good bit away (therefore he had to have moved out) usually after work at night (solely because I had my job).\n\nAbout a month or two ago, I quit putting $30 of gas in my car every week and just decided to do $10 as needed every few days.\n\nAbout a week ago, I had a mental breakdown as I realized I had ruined my life with college. I did in fact still hate college as much as I did last year and had absolutely no interest in my degree, on top of the fact that because I did no work I was forced to drop out. The worst part was that I lied to my parents the entire time (therefore I had to be lying the entire time), telling them I loved it and was on top of everything. Realizing my life is now \u2018live a lie\u2019 or \u2018confess and face being kicked out\u2019, I lied in bed that night and after crying for the first time in forever, I said \u201cjust give me one clear sign about what to do next\u201d (therefore I had to ask for this or else I may not have perceived the coincidence as so coincidental). What I was really asking the Universe was: college or my passion?\n\nSo, let\u2019s go back to a few days ago, the day after my mental breakdown.\n\nTwo days earlier, I get low on weed (therefore I had to be proactive about my weed stash which I\u2019m usually not) so I tell my friend I\u2019ll need some soon. He says he\u2019ll pick up the next day (Wednesday) but doesn\u2019t end up texting me back (and I don\u2019t either, which is unusual of me). I don\u2019t go until Thursday (therefore he has to have it ready the next day).\n\nAbout two weeks ago, one of my coworkers realized I\u2019m a pushover and can use me for car rides home every night (therefore he needs to work with us, during my shifts, for the same hours, have no car, be my friend, and know I\u2019ll take him home). He asked for one that Thursday night, so I wait an hour for him. Actually, I didn\u2019t have a plan, I was just kinda sitting there, then after about an hour I was like \u201calright bruh you\u2019re walking home\u201d and left. This is actually atypical because (1) he usually doesn\u2019t take an hour and (2) I usually don\u2019t wait an hour for someone. So, I start heading to my friend.\n\nI needed gas! I had procrastinated getting gas (like I always do). I also have a really bad habit of hating making stops when driving, so I tell myself I\u2019ll only hit up a gas station on my right on the way up, that way it\u2019s as fluent as possible. There\u2019s only 2 of these I can go to before I\u2019d have to make a u-turn to get to my friend.\n\nI pass the one I said I\u2019d go to and for some reason, at the very last second, decide not to (therefore I now only have one choice left)\u2014 probably because I knew there was another ahead. Despite the fact that I knew that the one ahead would inconveniently change my route, I went anyways.\n\nSo, I get there. Almost every spot is open, I hesitate to pick one. I choose one (had to be this specific one), get gas, yadda yadda. I think I decided to get $15 of gas instead of my usual $10/$12. This is important because it made me stay those few extra seconds that allowed the guy to get out of his car before I shut my door.\n\nAs I\u2019m leaving, a car pulls up behind me. He gets out of his car and says \u201chey young man\u201d. Me, who has been \u201chassled\u201d like this before thrice thought to myself \u201cjesus i just want to go get my weed please leave me alone\u201d.\n\nNow, let\u2019s make something clear. He starts the conversation asking for money. He wants gas, I understand, but I don\u2019t have any cash on me, and \u201csir look how little I put in my own car\u201d. There\u2019s a little truth to that but mostly I just want to get away before I\u2019m trapped in a moral dilemma. Anyways, point is that **I\u2019m pretty confident the guy just wanted money and when I said no he had to come up with something else to talk to me about so I didn\u2019t think he was a beggar.** This is fine\u2014 I wasn\u2019t going to think that anyways\u2014but it is kind of annoying, because it\u2019s already 10:40 PM and I WANT MY WEED!\n\n**The Coincidence**\nFinally, it gets weird. Again, **I fully understand he\u2019s just trying to make convo, likely to soften me into compromising into giving him some money,** but it gets really weird. He asks if I have a job, what I do, am I in college\u2014 which is kinda weird to me to ask someone at the gas station as they\u2019re obviously trying to leave but oh well. I tell him I\u2019m not in college since I just set in stone my plan to drop out the night earlier. **He says that God told him to tell him to tell me to go specifically MY college\u2019s financial center to help me out.** Now, realistically, he tells me to do this because (A) I\u2019m a busboy, which I told him, (B) I have no money to give him, (C) I put so little money in my own car that I told him was \u201cvery good on gas\u201d, and (D) I think I told him college was too expensive. **So, whilst it is weird what he said, it\u2019s pretty obvious why he said it and how far the reason is from what I was looking for.** He also said something about \u201cnot listening to my friends\u201d, which I do largely agree with, however one of my friends just a few days earlier jokingly said \u201cyou should drop out and become a full time <my passion>\u201d and I was like \u2018ah you don\u2019t say\u2019.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s it. I still didn\u2019t listen to him, and maybe therefore the universe. I think I have lots of bad karma on the way for that, but I also hope that the\u2014if it was a sign\u2014 that the universe knew I was never going to back to college and just sent that guy as a way to solidify my decision.\n\nI am usually all for \u201cit\u2019s just the butterfly effect bro\u201d, but there are so many variables in play here that had to be so precise for this event to happen: not just in my life, but theirs\u2019 (my friend, the coworker, and the gas station guy) too. With ANY slight change, it wouldn\u2019t have happened.\n\nI could probably say something about free will here too but you\u2019ve read enough.",

You risk ridicule and punishment. You may end up locked up in a padded room or behind bars. Historically, it seems this has always been the case. Think witch trials or countless reports in biblical text of what happens when people believe in witnessed gnostic accounts that do not fit the script of those days. \n\nTaking all this into consideration, we can see that people in the past took risks to spread whatever word was received.

Whatever is happening is because it is an effect. The cause is already planted, the seeds that we plant are the deeds. They will bear fruit. Therefore, there's no question of whether there is karma or not. Spiritually, when we realize we are not the doer of karma, then we are liberated from karma. We are liberated from the cycle of suffering and sorrow. There will be no tomorrow because we will be united with the Divine. This happens when we realize we are the Soul, the Spark of Unique Life and we are not the doer of actions. We do not own any action, any karma.",

You're not the ego that create the agony of anger, hate, revenge and jealousy. Therefore, when you're enlightened, the body will be hungry, but you don't suffer the body may fall sick or get tired, but you are peaceful. Generally you will sleep well because your mind is under your control. Your social interactions will be in a new state because you're free from all attachments and relationships.

I didn\u2019t know whether these things were good or bad at that time and because I trusted them because they were my family I would go and do those acts with them. I\u2019m ashamed to say that because it was so repeated over years, I started getting addicted to it. Not necessarily porn but pleasing myself. At a very young age. I hate that I had to be introduced to these things at that age and suffer a terrible fate at the hands of someone I truly care about till this day. He was also very young at the time to which I\u2019m surprised he even knew about these things like that at that age. So because he was also pretty young I don\u2019t hold a grudge and because I\u2019m very close with him. I still love him and care about him and would never want him to suffer anything for it because he didn\u2019t know what he was doing was wrong too. I had another family member once walk in on it and just stood there shocked but never said anything about it or paged them. Because I\u2019m still kinda addicted to the act of pleasing myself, will I suffer by being reborn here in my next life. I\u2019m a Hindu and I know lust is a huge sin and I really wish this hadn\u2019t happened to me. I didn\u2019t know this was considered trauma until I told a friend of mine today and she looked at me in shock and started crying about how disturbing my childhood was. Please someone tell me how I can get rid of this addiction and if I will have to suffer a karma for having this addiction. I don\u2019t enjoy having lustful thoughts at time and it disgusts me at times even but sometimes it just hard for me to not think like that.",

          "content": "This story will probably sound a bit silly, but I wanted to hear some advice anyway lol. I should preface this by saying I am no stranger to casual dating/online dating, and have been in a handful of long and short relationships. That is to say, I have a good idea of how I generally feel when i meet someone/in the beginning of a relationship. \n\n\nI went on a date with this guy on tinder, and right from the start things were kind of\u2026 weird? As soon as I matched with him I immediately just felt super drawn to him. He had literally  nothing about himself in his profile, and quite honestly really cringey/unattractive pictures of himself, so i had no idea why I felt drawn to him. He didn\u2019t even try to have a conversation with me, just asked me out on a date, and then proceeded to cancel that first date 3 times at the last minute. I say all this to give context to how weird it was that I felt so drawn to this dude. I had tons of other (better seeming) guys asking me out, but immediately wanted nothing to do with them. \n\n\nWe did have a date eventually, and it ended up being an amazing night. We had everything in common with me, he was seriously like the boy version of me. We just immediately connected and ended up talking for 9 hours, and he kept talking about when we could go on our next date, how much he liked me, and things he wanted to do with me. It sounds silly, but i have never had an experience like that with someone before. He texted me the next day to ask me out on a second date, but like before he would initiate plans with me just to cancel at the last second, saying he wasn\u2019t handling the stress of school well ( it was midterms, and he\u2019s in the program at our uni known for being the hardest in the country, so i was willing to cut him slack). Ultimately, he ghosted me by standing me up for a dinner date he had planned. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been weeks and i can\u2019t stop thinking about him, even though i know what he did was shitty   . I\u2019m just so confused about the pull i felt to him, and why the universe would put a connection like that in my life just for one night. Any insight or advice on this? thank you",

And I also know that tarot readers (some) may say what you want to hear for their own benefit whether it be money or recognition. But hear me out on this because I need advice..\n\nSo growing up I\u2019ve always felt a strong connection to people, music, frequencies, animals, etc.. you name it. I joined a livestream a few weeks ago and at first for about 45 minutes didn\u2019t say anything just watched different people\u2019s readings go about. I decided to ask for one because I felt the vibe was genuine from the reader and their audience. \n\nImmediately the reader said when they saw my name they felt a strong presence almost similar to that of a spirit guide. Which obviously I know as a human in this form I cannot be. But the reader was in a sense \u201cstarstruck\u201d (idk how else to word it). \n\nI consider myself to be an empathetic and pretty passionate person but I don\u2019t personally do readings or anything like that. Just am always the person people connect with off bat or come to advice for. Id like to think im very nurturing and compassionate with a big heart.\n\nI guess im asking if there\u2019s a term for this stance that I have in life? Is it just an over abundance of positive energy? Or is there a term for it?\n\nI\u2019ve always felt like I have more abilities than others in the sense of vibes and frequencies but dont know how to pin point it.",

In addition to that, I don\u2019t enjoy being single. I lack experience when it comes to dating because I\u2019ve only been in one relationship. The reason why I want to rush into a relationship is because more experience, and I want to have an emotional connection with another person.

Maybe it's a lesson, cuz they all said same thing about me either beeing too kind, too naive or im just straight dumb and slow to work. Idk what kind of lesson i should learn here, but i wouldn't want to attract that anymore, cuz it'll get more ridiculous if i get fired for 5th time. Maybe I'm not moving on the right track im supposed to, but i have no idea what's my place and finding out is such a painful process because i still need money to survive in this world.   \n\nAnyway want to hear ur thoughts, cheers",

Can you tell me more about this?\n\nANSWER: Every soul on the planet is split into many parts, yet you see yourselves as singular, linear individuals. Therefore, what you were told is accurate metaphysically and interdimensionally. Know this: You are also many parts, some of whom are on the other side of the veil, and some of whom actually reside with other Humans on this planet as guides.\n\nThis is the most complex thing we have ever told you, and we have broached this very issue many times. So don't be surprised if you find the information has morphed its way into some kind of simple singular explanation. It isn't simple, and it's not understandable as long as you consider yourselves \"one.\"\n\nEditor's note: Please see \"Group Energy\" on the alphabetical Q&A Index. Also, here's a reference to what Kryon is speaking of: [http://kryon.com/inspiritmag/archives/Q-A%20archives/2004-Q%26A/Q%26A-1rstquarter04.html#48]\n\nYup.",

          "content": "My mom has several different stories of seeing/interacting with a blue ball of light.\n\nShe claims growing up, she would sleep over at her grandmothers house (who was very spiritually connected and lived in a very very old Brooklyn brownstone) and at night sometimes a blue orb of light would slowly drift into her bedroom and hover near her bed. She was scared of it and would hide under the covers until it would eventually go back out the room. \n\nThis story is actually my sisters experience- She once was dating someone who lived in their grandparents house after they died, and claimed their grandparents were still very present. My sister had many paranormal experiences here but one strange one was that once she woke up in the middle of the night to a large man wearing tribal type clothing and of island or Polynesian descent (not related to said partner) who had several blue orbs of light that he was swirling around in his hands.\n\nThe final experience is that my mom once couldn\u2019t sleep in the middle of the night and drove to a nearby park on a lake. This park had a historical protected graveyard off to the side of the lake near some overgrown brush. It was pitch black and after a few minutes she noticed a tiny blue light that she thought was maybe a boat or something. But then she noticed it was slowly getting bigger and brighter and that it was on the waters edge. Eventually it was a baseball sized glowing blue orb. My mom suddenly felt a very powerful and visceral feeling of anger, hatred, fear, pain etc. and she floored it out of the park.\n\n\nAre these just spirits? Is this a specific spiritual phenomenon? Why do some spirits manifest this way?",

Many people dont, many infants die in first months. Back in the day people had more children so only those strong enough would survive. Same goes for other animals.\n\n Since we artifically increased our survival rate, which still is not available for many, universe doesnt care about your survival. So it is question about nature of life itself. It tries to survive, all cells in your body try to keep you alive. Survival everyday, you could die any moment if something in your body would refuse to go right. With these things in mind i think that talking about nature of out existence in regards to how life is treated here gives me an insight that we as humans dont matter that much in comparsion to other animals, given time and what we know about the past. We are just like ants nothing more. \n\nSo i am just happy about being alive and trying to understand why things are the way they are i am curious what is your outlook on this, staying grounded and keeping in mind all of what i have just written here. \n\nAlso i belive that almost all western internet lives in delusion how reality looks because they have it so good. Check out statistics about homelesness, sicknesses, hunger, wars, about 800 mln people have no access to electricty, and then come back to your phone and think again if what you are writing here is actually not delusional. Bubble, propaganda, people being in their heads, not thinking of outside world. Who has made things you are using, including phone (kids in Congo mining coltan) If you were ok you would help those in need, not talking about your ego boosting \"awakening\" that mean basically \" i know so much omg\" while on the other side someone is suffering. I am at least not running away from the fact that i am to some extent ignorant and i am not helping those in need also my purpose isnt aligned with helping those in need i rather feed my ego and look for peace for myself.

          "content": "There are few things that make me have doubts more than this. Some of you might have heard of it, a few years ago, a Norwegian celebrity came out and said that the \"illusion\" of life after death takes advantage of people, he wanted to prove that it's not real. He set up a secret code and so far, no psychic or medium has been able to find it or communicate with him. I would have said, all that study proved was that those specific mediums couldn't contact him, but apparently that's making excuses.\n\nI just... I'm upset about it. I had a devastating loss and I'm angry for my parents, who lost their kid at a very young age and have had people shit all over their comfort. Now, there are fraudulent mediums, yes, but I don't get how it does anyone harm for us to believe we'll see her again. Not just that, but we *have* had experiences with ADCs, and I've been gaslighted by people trying to convince me that they didn't happen. But why are there so many stories like this? Where people ask for signs and don't get them and with this guy, apparently, nobody has contacted him. Honestly, for trying to take that comfort away from people, part of me does wish his soul was just destroyed. I know that's silly but I wouldn't want to make contact with such an asshole. And the skeptic community loves it. The guys dead now. And I don't give a shit. He wanted to do something to help people being \"deluded\", and probabymade many feel depressed or suicidal from losing hope.\n\nI find it hard to take these things seriously because not too long ago, the story about Houdini's wife was circulated online. She asked for an ADC and never got it, apparently. The thing is, some sources say she did get it eventually but just kept it private. But it's just- what is with people wanting to *disprove* everything? I'd there any merit to it? Did this Norwegian guy prove any points? It's just disheartening.",

It lasts for some time till the song is over and then I don't remember it ever again.\n\nI've tried to sit and recollect but I fail everytime. I've wanted to pen down the lyrics or play my guitar the way it's played so effortlessly in my head - I always fail to do it at that moment.\n\nPS - I've had good intuition most of my life. I just know something is about to happen and it happens minutes/years later. Not just obvious things but actual unpredictable things.

This self-realization leads to God-realization. We experience God in the temple of our heart. We realize every Soul is a Spark Of Unique Life, is SIP, the Supreme Immortal Power. This leads us to liberation, liberation from all misery on earth and liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Then, ultimately, we reach that state of unification with the Divine when the body dies. There is no mind and ego, ME that carries karma into another birth. We the Divine Soul become one with the supreme. This is Nirvana, Moksha, salvation. This is much beyond enlightenment.",

The basic message is there never was an individual and regardless of what is experienced there is already everything which is whole, or wholeness, and is already free from the need for anything to happen and so is complete, there's just absolute freedom, and it\u2019s the experience of being an individual which covers that over or hides it. Jim Newman on youtube talks about non-duality and does a good job in my opinion at expressing this freedom. But then another thing that also helped is that it can't be ruled out that there is not an intelligence that is the universe or all energy and therefore includes 'us' so we are that intelligence and that is who we really are, again we were never an individual and we were always the oneness and are just as much everyone and everything else as much as the body we are looking from. But regardless of what happens, including an intelligence that is the universe, there is already everything which is whole, complete, and free.",

Is there anyone else that had something similar? \n\nI met one woman who said she had the same sort of fainting spells also as a teen, but when she fainted she would go to an emptyness (I think it was a very unpleasant experience for her).",

In 2020 I was introduced to what I know as spirituality and manifestation techniques\u2026 Im into astrology but also do frequent spiritual things like writing affirmations on full/new moons, practice positive self concept and self talk into the mirror while using hz frequencies, i\u2019ve written manifestations with moon water and fire, and  sleeping to theta frequencies to connect to my\nsubconscious to strengthen my manifestations of my desired reality.. i\u2019ve even tried to speak myself into a new reality as i have found interest in \u201cthe universe experiencing itself of it all\u201d and law of assumption -esq vibes  (i\u2019ve gotten my energy cleansed once  before by a professional spiritual\npractice (i can\u2019t remember her actual title) but she saw the energy within my chakras and cleared it back in 2021.  and dabbled in crystals \u2026. ) \n\nSince october , Ive been focusing on a few specific manifestations and i just got news today that one of the ones i was hoping to manifest turned out to not be what i had wanted\u2026.. \n\nI just don\u2019t know why I, when writing these affirmations /practicing these manifestation techniques\u2026 I feel so strongly and so surely in myself and what I manifesting I give back a lot of gratitude in my letters/positive self talk to myself into the universe and the things I asked for aren\u2019t presented to me :( a little bummed as I was manifesting something very specific to my future and I am sad that it didn\u2019t \u201dcome true\u201d in real time after getting word today \u2026 any tips on what I can do to strengthen my connection with the universe/myself, so I can better bring my manifestations to me faster and exactly like i asked?",

Go back to his place again, and I asked if I would ever see him again, and basically got a no but in a nice way. I thought it was the end of that. But 2 weeks later, I was literally at a completely different club in a different area and he was there again. Go back to his place, part 3. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t sound that shocking, but it\u2019s New York City. Like it\u2019s huge here. I barely run into my friends. I find it really strange I ran into the same guy so many times in different places. He\u2019s also met all my friends, each time I would go out with different close friends and now he\u2019s met my entire friend circle. My best friend since GRADE SCHOOL came to visit that one weekend and met him too. I want to know if this has any meaning, because I really like him (our personalities go well, like when I would go home with him, we would actually talk about everything, in the morning cuddle and talk too) but obviously he doesn\u2019t feel the same way back.",

          "content": "On 2/22/2022 I was seeing so many videos saying to manifest on this date. Reason was a mirror date is the best day because anything you wanted to focus on could reflect basically for your future. Think love life, career, etc. I was in a difficult time in my life. I hated my job and I just left a toxic relationship. I felt like my entire life purpose was being questioned. Turning 30 you think everything would be figured out but it wasn\u2019t the case. I felt very lost in so many ways.\n\nAnyway, I decided to manifest that night and be open to what I would feel. I am pretty spiritual so I am already very open and willing to these things. I found a sound frequency guided meditation playlist and I began to silence my thoughts in the dark. It\u2019s best to let the frequencies guide me through this process and let go. I had been practicing meditation for a few weeks before this so I got pretty deep. I asked myself career wise what is my purpose what could I see myself doing. I then saw myself believe it or not doing permanent makeup which I was interested in. Many things were gravitating me to the tattoo industry itself as well. \n\nI was about another 30 minutes in and began to ask about my purpose in life. I was dealing with so much depression and self consciousness. I saw my elder self and felt as if she was there hugging me and smiling. So warm and so friendly. I envisioned her with long gray hair and she made me feel that everything was going to be ok. With my eyes still closed I moved into a sitting position and leaned to the right to cry on her shoulder. I felt overwhelmed so I opened my eyes to end the mediation and felt like I made a major breakthrough.\n\nThe next day I go to my warehouse job and they announce they are closing. My jaw dropped because I was manifesting a change in career but was not expecting it to be so strong to shut down the whole dang place! (Jk we were slowly going bankrupt prior to this night) so eventually we close, I start a tattoo apprenticeship and have now been doing tattoos and pmu for over a year. I am currently now with my soul mate and have non stop seen angel numbers since this day. I will always remember how vivid my meditative visions were.",

I admit I have over the course of time proven to have a bit of an anxious attachment style in relationships, but I have felt it less with the guy I am with now. \n\nI met someone almost three years back who I instantly clicked with, through work. Things were hot and cold, and a year later (after he had moved on to a new job) we reconnected and confessed our mutual feelings for each other. I ended up cutting it off as I was about to move to a different country and I felt he was messing me around again, and we haven't really spoken since. I unfollowed him on Instagram, but he still follows me and likes every post I make.\n\nMy thing that I am caught up on though, is that I can't seem to shake him from my mind. It isn't necessarily an everyday thing, but it is too constant that I think about him. Some days nothing, but other days I am - almost obsessively thinking of him. I don't know if this has a spiritual meaning or not, I would just like to see what others have to think of it. Nothing intimate has ever happened between us, only that we both knew we had feelings for one another, and the sexual tension was crazy. \n\nUsually I'd be able to shake something like this off, but it hasn't so far. And I worry it won't any time soon. I don't know what to do or if my subconscious is telling me something. I don't necessarily want to be with him right now, as he was always so hot and cold and it was all so confusing with him. But I just don't understand why I can't shake him from my mind. \n\nPlease help if you can.",

Outside one if the rooms upstairs from me, just above the room number were markings in black ash...there were 3 straight lines almost in the form of a triangle that circled the room number.

However, via the influence of my more spiritually attuned fianc\u00e9, a few uniue experiences and life forcing me to hit my rock bottom I've become interested in and hyperfixated on exploring my spirituality. I'm ready to let go of my hangups and my unwillingness to believe in anything and start taking my life into my own hands, starting from the inside out.\n\nI've been lurking reddit forums and youtube channels looking for information on where to start, and tried picking up a few used books that were very cheap. But I take such a clinical approach to research and learning on my own, and beyond my fianc\u00e9 and his own limited knowledge, I don't have any outside guidance on the topic. I get the feeling I'm not going to pick up on this easily -- I am willing to put the work in, but I'd love some advice on where to start.\n\nI understand how broad this topic is, so ANY and all advice is appreciated! Even if it isn't exactly related to the question at hand, if it feels important to mention to a spiritually stunted beginner please do. I am open to learning in many different areas and want to know what 'spirituality' means to different people.\n\n\\--\n\nAs a sidenote, not necessarily as the main point of my post, I am interested in one particular theory I stumbled upon and have been trouble finding information on. I was not exactly 100% awake at the time and it was on TikTok, so I don't remember what it was called or all of the details. But it pertained to this idea that entire universe is one entity, higher than any one god or divine being, that takes many different forms in order to \"taste\" and experience itself. Like, \"your belief becomes your experience,\" \"you are god and so is everything else,\" or something to that effect. If this rings a bell or shares any similarities with any belief systems, practices or religions, please let me know because I am very curious!\n\n&#x200B;",

          "content": "The Complementary Nature of the Hero's Journey and the Fool's Journey\r  \nThe Hero's Journey and the Fool's Journey, while distinct in their narratives and symbolism, are complementary frameworks that together provide a comprehensive understanding of the human experience. These two journeys, one rooted in mythological exploration and the other in the symbolic progression of the Tarot, each reveal different but interconnected facets of an individual's path through life.\r  \n\r  \nThe Hero's Journey\r  \nJoseph Campbell's Hero's Journey, derived from his study of world mythologies, is a template that outlines the stages of a hero's adventure in the external world. This journey starts with the Call to Adventure, leading to the Crossing of the Threshold into a world of unknown challenges and opportunities. The hero faces Trials and Tribulations, receives Aid from mentors, and undergoes a Transformation. After achieving their goal or gaining new wisdom, the hero Returns to the ordinary world, often with a boon or insight to benefit society. This journey is outward-facing and action-oriented, focusing on physical and societal challenges and achievements.\r  \n\r  \nThe Fool's Journey\r  \nIn contrast, the Fool's Journey through the Tarot's Major Arcana symbolizes an inner spiritual and psychological journey. Beginning with The Fool, representing innocence and the potential for a new start, the journey progresses through various archetypal stages, reflecting an introspective path of self-discovery and personal growth. The journey involves encountering and integrating different aspects of the self, represented by the diverse figures and symbols of the Major Arcana, and culminates in The World, symbolizing wholeness and enlightenment. This journey is inward-looking, focusing on internal struggles, personal insights, and spiritual development.\r  \n\r  \nIntegration of the Two Journeys\r  \nThese two journeys, while distinct, are not mutually exclusive but rather complement each other. The Hero's Journey represents our engagement with the external world, our actions, and interactions within society, and the roles we play. It is about overcoming external obstacles, achieving goals, and the impact of our actions on the world around us. The Fool's Journey, meanwhile, represents our inner world, our subconscious, emotions, thoughts, and spiritual growth. It is about personal transformation, understanding our deeper selves, and the evolution of our consciousness.\r  \n\r  \nIncorporating Jung's Spirit of the Times and Depth\r  \nIntegrating Jung's concepts of the Spirit of the Times (Zeitgeist) and the Depth (the exploration of the unconscious) adds another layer to our understanding of these journeys.\r  \n\r  \nSpirit of the Times in the Journeys\r  \nThe Spirit of the Times, or Zeitgeist, refers to the prevailing cultural, social, and intellectual climate of an era. In the context of the Hero's Journey, it influences the societal norms, challenges, and expectations that the hero encounters and responds to. The journey becomes a reflection of the external world's values and conflicts at that time. In the Fool's Journey, the Spirit of the Times may manifest in the way personal growth and self-realization are understood and pursued, reflecting the collective consciousness and shared human experiences of the era.\r  \n\r  \nDepth and the Unconscious\r  \nDepth, in Jungian terms, refers to the exploration of the unconscious aspects of the psyche. In the Hero's Journey, this exploration might involve confronting personal fears, unconscious motives, or repressed aspects that are projected onto external challenges. In the Fool's Journey, the exploration of depth is more direct, as the journey itself is a path through the unconscious, encountering and integrating various hidden aspects of the self.\r  \n\r  \nConclusion\r  \nTogether, the Hero's Journey and the Fool's Journey, enriched by Jung's concepts of the Spirit of the Times and Depth, create a holistic view of the human journey. They encompass both the external and internal realms, the conscious and unconscious dimensions, and the influence of the collective cultural climate. This integrated perspective offers a profound understanding of the multifaceted nature of human existence, the process of personal and societal evolution, and the journey towards self-awareness and fulfillment in both the physical and spiritual realms.",

I'm not sure if she was big on Witchcraft etc., but I'm pretty sure she's done certain things and mainly played with stuff regarding the dead (she's done a few seances before), thought I don't know about curses she's performed.   \nWhen I was in a relationship with her, I'm not sure if this counts as a curse, I was practically obsessed with her, I couldn't think about anything but her and when I was away from her I also only thought about her.   \nI never had that happen to me before, but I didn't really think much of it.   \nAfter that my love life was basically garbage.   \nI'm a pretty average person in regards of character and looks etc. so I don't think it's because of my character nor looks either.\n\nI'm also a very mentally healthy person, self-confident person , I get good grades, I love my family, I'm nice to animals and to strangers.

          "content": "How to adapt to this new understanding of reality after gaining spiritual insights?\n\nI see our reality as a theatre. We're basically living in this massive show directed by money, and the top 1% has crafted and perfected the script. We vote for the people they tell us to, watch the movies they put out, and eat the food they provide. Supermarkets are filled with their brands, making it hard to find alternatives. The food they give us is often very much processed, loaded with toxic and addictive stuff. They make unhealthy food because it is the cheapest and most convenient, creating an offer we can't easily refuse. We become addicted in many ways, and they tempt us everywhere. Everything is full of billboards and commercial, the ads being pushed everywhere we might look.\n\nWhen we get sick from consuming their unhealthy food, we're left with little choice but to sacrifice financial stability for our health. We end up paying thousands to facilities they own, where they prescribe us more harmful chemicals that most of the times just numb the symptoms.  \nWe go to schools eight hours a day learning what they want us to learn. They grab our attention at age 5 and never really give it back. They scold us until we obey, then praise us when we do. We form a habit of spending our entire day in a building we wouldn't choose, so when we grow up, we're okay doing the same. Following orders becomes comfortable after a childhood of doing what we're told.  \nThey tell us we should do anything to go to university because  otherwise we fail. \n\nThey manipulate us into financial dependence early on so we stay chained to the system. They've given us a currency which has value only because they say so and we collectively agreed with it. We earn it working for businesses they own. Their wealth multiplies while the rest of us are forced to sacrifice our time for minuscule fraction of what our work gains for them. Housing is provided,  but made it very costly, making it tough to accumulate enough wealth to escape from this show. Society is structured around addictive foods causing disease and expensive drugs masking them, keeping us trapped.  \nWe only consume content they provide. News channels are run by them to push opposing perspectives, preventing us from sharing the same opinion. They feed us shocking news to grab our attention away from what's really happening in the world. Superficial idols with luxurious lifestyles are granted to us so we associate money with happiness.\n\nThey keep us focused on worldly problems they've created to distract us from our higher selves. If we concentrate on our surroundings, we'll never be present and realize our true power within ourselves. \n\nImagine if everyone believed we exist for a reason, and we are all connected to something bigger than us. We'd unlock an unbreakable faith within ourselves and reverse the power structure society was built on. We'd see past the lies, turn to each other for help, and stop depending on corrupt leaders.  \nThe majority of us see the world as it's portrayed \u2013 diverse and plausible. But looking behind the curtain, we find lies, endless deception, and a power trip that's been ongoing since the very beginning. It will continue until we see a reason for change and stop hating and blaming each other.\n\nAm I crazy, or my reality is just different than yours? Spirituality brought a lot of positive changes in my life but it also feels sometimes very challenging to balance it with practicality.  \n\nIf you made it this far sorry for the long post and thanks for reading it. <3 ",

          "content": "So I got a sound bowl two years ago for my 18th birthday but I never found the time to use it. Then a few months ago I was looking into sound therapy to reduce the programming of music on my brain (In my religion music is banned) and so i realized the sound bowl can produce binaural beats naturally in contrast to the computer generated binaural beats.\r  \n\r  \nI was using the sound bowl simply for experimenting with potent frequencies on my brain, but what I found next was nothing short of a miracle in my eyes.\r  \n\r  \nYou see I\u2019ve been suffering from auditory and visual hallucinations for a hot minute now, and soon the more I started striking the sound bowl, the more it began to neutralize the hallucinations as it overpowered the noise in my brain. It\u2019s weird, it\u2019s like the binaural beats are digging deep within my mind and cancelling out all the noise it produces.\r  \n\r  \nThere is something psychological about sound therapy that taps into the unseen parts of the mind in where hallucinations are produced. My conspiracy theory behind it is that my brain produces low frequencies that I cannot hear that spawns the hallucinations. And so when I play potent healthy frequencies it taps into the root cause of the hallucinations, essentially nipping it in the bud.\r  \n\r  \nThis has been an amazing coping mechanism for my schizophrenia and I\u2019ve likened it to a fidget toy for people with adhd. This is like a spiritual fidget toy for people with schizophrenia.\r  \n\r  \nI hope this knowledge benefits you in some way. I am currently writing a 40 day journal on the sound therapy and it\u2019s going by really well.\r  \n\r  \nThanks for reading! Have a wonderful day.",

It's just a breathe away. \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e Be happy you're here, allot of us might go in 50 years if we are entitled to and hopefully the planet keeps moving. Take care of earth be happy and all will be well. Praise God praise earth love life. Trying to keep you grounded and focused on the present as well as you're on earth reading this.

Truth consciousness is the state of thoughtlessness, the state of awareness or mindfulness. When you block the mind, you lock the mind and you activate the intellect, then you discriminate the truth from the myth. And when you are in consciousness of the truth, then you reach a state of eternal peace and everlasting happiness. You realize that this world is a cosmic illusion. You realize that everything is a drama, and life is karma, then there is no trauma. To reach that state of constant happiness, we need to reach that state of liberation from misery and sorrow. We need to stop jumping into yesterday and tomorrow. We need to tame the monkey mind. All this happens, when we reach that state of truth consciousness. Then we will experience eternal bliss.",

          "content": "How many of us really think we agreed to everything prior to incarnating here to what we\u2019re experiencing, or that this all even stems from human activity alone? Yes, we make personal choices to change our thinking and behaviors, and implement better ways of doing things. But is our own personal work we\u2019re doing alone enough? Enough to bring in this \u2018New Earth\u2019 that\u2019s talked about in spiritual communities, whatever that truly means? \n\nMany people say all you need to do is become conscious and practice your consciousness in the ways we do with meditation and all that. But is this alone enough? Primarily asked since there\u2019s a lot of increasing influences and distortions that can deter an individual off their track, multiple times. \n\nGoing back to- It can\u2019t be fathomed how these \u2018positive \u2018 or less dense beings ( I\u2019ll include here less density upward ascension models still includes the unconsciousness we have to bring to light, hence the graduations through the polarity) could agree to allow the degree of the turmoil. That we agreed to all of it\u2026It\u2019s like politics, the republicans and democrats. They represent two sides of the spectrum fighting on behalf of two very \u2018different\u2019 sides when they\u2019ve been pictured eating together, like a family\u2026 There\u2019s a game of what we think is going on vs other missing moving parts that are just as much relevant and imperative that what we don\u2019t fully take into account that would help to get the greater picture of this story. \n\nMeditating on these questions especially asking beings during this can lead to having some correct answers whilst can leave you on a goose chase with the rest of it. Your own gnosis would be better developed if provoking the \u2018knowns\u2019.  In saying this, we can\u2019t always avoid falling into pitfalls to really find out the answers. You can\u2019t always protect yourself from these things that we all need to know in our own way in a varied systemic environment. Feeling duped will come about because we didn\u2019t \u2018get the assignment\u2019 but what\u2019s a test with all the answers given. We think that knowing things ahead of time will prevent disasters, but it is what it is. This is the real assignment though. To grow through and out of our ignorance in all the ways that are presented. To grow an inner strength that will help give us leaps and bounds to what we can accomplish in our lifetimes here with our mental/psychic abilities, giving a more wholesome development overall and understanding on things. \n\nWe may know things but not simultaneously and it\u2019s difficult to get it out in edgewise so we\u2019ll present what we have experienced thus far. There\u2019s that. It would be very advantageous to ask ourselves again especially with how much has changed, what we\u2019ve been told or learned long ago, whether we asked ourselves or others especially beings, the same questions now with the underlying energies of the present time. To compare and contrast an older version of that which was understood vs now how it\u2019s understood. The former doesn\u2019t always stand up to the now so it\u2019s good to test these understands along the way, whether that be religions, traditions, thought processes, etc\u2026\n\n\u2018What we do here echoes out into eternity\u2019, said someone. What we do here affects our other selves since we\u2019re multidimensional beings. But if we can\u2019t find our way through the deceptions in this dimension and one\u2019s we connect to (as above so below) then how are we going to recognize what\u2019s what upon escaping the prison plane if we can\u2019t escape these things here whilst living here first?  How are we going to join with our other selves or be able to go to where we want after leaving here without learning the important concepts? Developing spiritual practices, so many to consider. But If you have an inclination to assist more on a system level then don\u2019t ignore those nudges as well. If our consciousness is informed of a more boots on the ground approach to also help move things along, that\u2019s very advantageous. I realized after the help of others\u2019 perspectives to have a more wholistic discernment of the masquerading energies, but that it\u2019s all a masquerade. What do you do? Follow your own suit. Following your own truth while editing yourself along the way with the above considerations in mind and whatever other considerations that\u2019ll assist in remembering our personal truth.\n\nThe Mind\n\nIf we know that there\u2019s the idea of the mind and how expansive that is and how we\u2019re all a part of that, then why have we relegated much of the understanding of psychology to mean only human psychology, not connecting that to what is known as \u2018The Mind\u2019? The different nuances, the interplay with our mind with with greater one? Saying this isn\u2019t an evasion of taking personal responsibility to give ourselves the care we need, but there seems to be this responsibility we have that has a much farther reach, hence why I mention this. Yes there\u2019s different branches of psychology and the closest we have is panpsychism, then there\u2019s transpersonal psychological and parapsychology and other concepts that connect the spiritual to the human, yet there\u2019s still this reduction placed on how we can more accurately relate to what we experience in our human experience, our mental process to that of the greater mental workings in greater capacities. And if by knowing this we could get a more cohesive understanding and approaches to caring for our selves. \n\nThis can be beneficial PSA for those who\u2019ve been dismissed or plainly redirected to a therapist for their mental discord, which is described as plainly mental illness, but wonder how some of the discord can also be remediated by a more cohesive thought, and how it\u2019s not going to be all solvable going to a therapist alone. But having a wholistic practice to feel connected to self in all ways and not feel so disconnected, to continue feeding in the separation idea.\n\nThere used to be a more thorough understanding, (not that there isn\u2019t now it\u2019s just more divisive) an acceptance many years ago in how psychology, the psyche, included the mind that spanned across space and time, how we divorced our perceptions from that and reduced it to the psychology we know is, well, isn\u2019t hard to believe given the topic discussed. Anyhow, that\u2019s what I have for now. Take care.",

          "content": "Thoughts on stuff\u2026\n\nThe fact all things in this universe as we generally can understand have a polarity of positive and negative. That all things in existence have the characteristics within, from nature to humans to others. Including the beings that are called upon worked in spiritual/occult practices. \n\nHow are we certain that all are good or all are bad on an all inclusive reality? How did we get that mixed up. Because if we think about it when we say false light vs say real light, this wouldn\u2019t be accurate based on the reality of things. Perhaps we wanted to believe that there is something out there that\u2019s genuinely good so we make these distinctions when really there\u2019s gradients of densities, positive or negative: these two \u2018opposites\u2019 occur on a spectrum. Both sides lie for what agendas they want to be accomplished which ultimately boils down to the one agenda. Neither have any obligation to you, to really like you, let alone \u2018love\u2019 you, and to actually take your best interest at heart. To a degree yes but again taking into consideration what the return is for them.\n\nIf you take the example of how humans are some, most (however you want to look at it) are generally ok, good, they might help you or they may not. That\u2019s their choice. If they help you sometimes you get the outcome you wanted sometimes not. There\u2019re maybe manipulations, gaslighting involved into getting what you wanted too. But then how and why would this reflection outwards not be the same as the other beings\u2019 behaviors? Why do we think they are excluded from participating in being liars and deceivers when they too are over compensating for a lack, a separation we have yet to understand? Interestingly a separation we too share? \n\nIs there ever any wonder though on how that all gets orchestrated behind the scenes and other beings, the interaction of our will, the other persons will vs the beings will? The universe? When you ask them and present them your case and want a certain outcome, how does your will stands against theirs? How do we know we couldn\u2019t have gotten a better outcome than we did or didn\u2019t have to toil for things as long and hard a we did? Sure there\u2019s lessons and things to go through but is that the whole story? \n\nIts like a political hodgepodge, battle of wills the war on your attention for their actions we support when we don\u2019t know fully what we support given the dynamics. A parade of blended dogmas for a singular major cause.\n\nMy point is there\u2019s this game, or paradigm that exists most all know about by the name of the Matrix, about the negative entities, \u2018agents\u2019 and the harvesting of humans and all that jazz. But you ever wonder how the more \u2018positive\u2019 beings could\u2019ve allowed things to happen in congruence to\u2019 their\u2019 game alone and then there\u2019s this growing confusion that occurs resulting in us thinking it\u2019s just \nall the negative entities against humanity and this planet? That they alone are the culprits for all the mayhem on Earth?\n\nThis game was probably agreed upon by both sides to make it look like it was one over the other. Hence the separation game and all the manifestations from this basis. Then somehow we inherited this idea that we \u2018agreed\u2019 to all these terms and conditions prior to incarnating into this Earth existence and feel obligated to support this notion, thereby causing delays and barriers in our paths we don\u2019t fully understand? I can see to a point us agreeing to degrees of separation, to an extent and on a personal front, but to what extent that has transpired collectively, I don\u2019t agree to all things that \u2018should\u2019 have and does happen here. To what extent we agreed and continue to\u2026I guess not all were going to become privy to the terms and conditions as well, but have adopted anyway this idea it\u2019s all \u2018gods plan\u2019 and to just trust and have faith to go with the flow. And to support this notion of balance that we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re helping to keep a balance of. \n\nThe balance changes when there\u2019s shifts in cycles, astrologically and so on. The \u2018balance\u2019 that was set eons ago by certain beings on this plane is absolutely subject to this, hence the post. It\u2019s like double speak. You\u2019re told \u2018 it\u2019s all about balance\u2019 yet we\u2019re fighting this balance because we know inherently things aren\u2019t right and were caught in this tug of war to keep our ground, do our practices but we\u2019re still entangled on what keeps us stuck. Hence this not fully understood tethering to the system. Not sure how else to describe it.",

          "content": "Hello everyone, happy Sunday to some of you! I've been wearing makeup every day since I was 13, feeling extremely insecure without it. My mom, who's very superficial, always preferred me in makeup, especially due to my severe acne. And even expected me to put it on before breakfast at weekends if I didn\u2019t she wouldn\u2019t stop nagging about my face. Yes i grew up in a very toxic household.\n In 2016 when I was almost 17, I started at a new school and was too tired to put on makeup one morning. That day marked the end of my daily makeup routine. Around the same time, I fell into depression, which made me care less and less about my appearance. I became passionate about sustainable fashion, avoiding fast fashion, and generally stopped focusing on my looks. This led to a drastic change in my appearance, and I noticed people sometimes reacted negatively to my \"homeless\" look, a term I use for lack of a better description, not to disrespect anyone. It is  not over exaggerated I really do look homeless sometimes  in my daily life \n\nEven in college, while I started caring a bit more, I rarely wore makeup due to my skin issues with acne my skin just hates it. I have a lot of red and purple scars now so even tho I have less cystic acne it still looks like my face is full of it.  My style hasn't improved much, though I occasionally enjoy dressing up. Despite no longer being depressed, I struggle to find the motivation to care about my appearance more again or a way of not feeling like anything that has to do with beauty in humans is just so extremely superficial and hurtful to so many. I mean I just do not actually  look the way I look when I put on my makeup and I don\u2019t want ppl to just like me bc I look approachable and not ugly and weird. Also clothes are just clothes and the reason I wear them nowadays is simply bc I need to wear something. \nBut I do really miss the joy of dressing up and feel dissatisfied with how I present myself.\n I know I do not like what I see in the mirror but I still feel like it\u2019s meaningless anyways to care about changing that. But lately I have  realised again he importance of aesthetics and being able see and create beautiful things and it is a beautiful thing to expirence this as a human in this lifetime. But even tho I never stopped loving beauty in nature and in design and also in other peoples creative expressions and looks I can not start caring about this with myself again. How are you able to start caring about appearance and feel like it\u2019s not plain stupid once you realised all of it is extremely meaningless?",

For the longest time, despite being spiritual, despite being a believer and perhaps something beyond that since I've had my own experiences, I have been reluctantly skeptical of anything to do with spirituality. It's become this routine to try to rule out every single skeptic explanation of something before I can accept it and I hate it.\n\nNow, I know skepticism is good in moderation, but at this point I want to let go and accept what I've been through. Between the atheist communities, figures like Dawkins and Hitchens, I feel fragile. You hear that there's no evidence of a soul existing and it's strange, it really comes down to what you define and accept as evidence, but it can still be disheartening to hear. To hear people still say it's all in the brain. To hear all this stuff, NDEs, out of body experiences, the signs you receive from departed loved ones, to have it all brushed off and head that it's \"debunked\", even if that isn't true, still makes it seem like thats the case.\n\nReddit is just rife with this mindset. I've had people gaslight me, try to convince me that certain things that I *know* happened didn't. People try to convince me I'm a mindless, soulless biological entity and a machine, just this sack of meat and chemicals. It's dehumanising. To have it framed as a \"cold hard truth\" that I'm too fragile to accept. Makes me think I'm the problem then, makes me second guess absolutely fucking everything. I just want it to stop.",

However weird this may sound, it is critical to embrace them. Wrestle with them until you come to terms with them.\n\nI'll use a physical example. I have been taking cold showers to try and build up resistance. It's winter, and I have poor insulation for the pipes, so the water is unbearably cold. I shout and squirm, resist the experience as much as possible, and then justify quitting early for whatever reason. Today, however, I sat there and let the frigid water run over my head until it went numb. I embraced the pain (to a reasonable point), and suddenly, the water felt fine over the rest of my body. Suddenly, I could deal with it as if it weren't happening. \n\nI am not saying the point of life is suffering or that you should run toward pain. Instead, there is a type of embrace or acceptance of the negative feelings, emotions, and experiences you have that allows them to become a part of your life without destroying it.\n\nI have been going through some soul-wrenching pain; I lost my children (still living), my family has turned away from me, and I have no partner in life. I experience pain constantly. Running from it and pushing it out leads to more pain and more suffering.

Is it truly necessary to dissolve these aspects of ourselves to reach higher states of consciousness or to attain enlightenment?\r  \n\r  \nSome points I've been considering are:\r  \n\r  \nThe Role of the Ego: The ego, despite its issues, plays a crucial role in our survival and daily functioning. Is it possible to maintain a healthy ego while pursuing higher consciousness?\r  \n\r  \nIdentity and Individuality: Our unique identities and experiences shape who we are. Is losing this sense of individuality truly beneficial, or is there a way to balance individuality with a sense of oneness?\r  \n\r  \nDifferent Philosophical Perspectives: Different traditions and philosophies offer varying views on this subject. Are there traditions that value the preservation of individual identity in the journey towards enlightenment?\r  \n\r  \nPersonal Experiences: For those who have delved deeply into these practices, how has your relationship with your ego and identity changed?\r  \n\r  \nI'm genuinely interested in understanding different perspectives on this topic. Whether you have a background in philosophy, spirituality, psychology, or just personal insights, I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.",

You love someone, you have planned everything with that person, that you both will live together, have children, move to another city & start a new life. you created this image or a path or a map or a plan for your future & you live according to it. but In coming days, you guys break up, that tears apart all the imagination, all the planning you ve had for your future. Which creates emptiness, a sense of no future no meaning to live life, becuase it shake the very base of yourself, of your psychology. \n\nNow you got no reason to live becuase all the planning has been shattered away. You try to escape this feeling through some form of entertainment, addictions, by ignoring it. No matter what you do to escape the fact that you are in a great misery, it is still there. it is the fact of yourlife. So, these things can bring you relief for few hours or days, but by ignoring it, you are just suppressing it. \n\nIt requires a great deal of energy to get over this situation. It takes so much time, & psychological drama. There is a one thing that helps him to get over this, which is to live with the fact. He ll realize that \"I did plan all these with my partner, and wanted to live like this, but the reality is something different, God has some different plans for him& there is no way but to live with what is\". He is finally able to accept the fact that all the dreams has broken & he has to live with this reality. \n\nThis fact becomes so intense & so dense that will give him his life back, gives him energy to get over it & start a new life. Everyone has to face this problem once in a lifetime, but the intelligent one get aware of this problem, problem of having a pre-determined future & its consequences.\n\nNext time when he / she will promise such thing to someone, he will be having a sense of uncertainty in the back of his mind, always. Whenever this thing repeats in his life, it won't affect him much, he will go through misery for sure, but the intensity will be very weak. Its not limited to the relationship only, but also true for all the aspects of one's life. Its necessary, it is God's gift to make you emotionally strong. Embrace it.",

          "author": "tryingtolive22",
          "content": "There is this one person who I am not really close to  (she's not a friend or family member) that exudes a lot of negativity towards me. I can't avoid her because she is my coworker and I have to work closely with her in particular. I have tried sending love, wishing her well, and realizing that I sometimes may be internalizing too much. I have also realized that maybe since she is already a bit \"mean\" that I may be  magnifying her micro-behaviors that may not be meant to be intentionally passive-aggressive.\n\nI have tried meditating to see what the problem is but I just can't pin-point this repulsion I feel towards her. I guess I was caught off guard because in the beginning when I met her she was super nice to me and pretended to be super close, and then she started acting all rude and distant (not saying hi to me even when I greet her, avoiding eye contact when I speak to her, her facial expressions of repulsion towards me). I don't know what I did. She just changed from one day to another. I think the only thing that may have made her switch was the fact that (I SUSPECT) that she liked one of my coworkers, and he was very friendly with me (I don't like him but we are friends) and she thought may be I was competition??? Anyway long story short about that, I have a feeling they are a friends with benefits now but still... why would she hate me for that if they're already a 'thing'? But like I said... I don't know if this is the exact reason why she switched from one day to another, but it's honestly the only situation that I could think of. (Another thing I should note is that my guy coworker has also starting acting more negative and distant, not always directly towards me but just in general, ever since he started hanging out with her. He used to be super friendly with me and now he avoids me and his attitude is more negative about work).\n\nWhat confuses me even more is that sometimes when I come into the office she's like \"Hi tryingtolive22!\" and she opens her arms to give me a hug. BUT IT FEELS SO FAKE! Like yesterday you were acting distant, and now you want to give me a hug??? Her hot and cold behavior is so confusing\n\nI guess I now feel repulsion towards her because she's giving off those feelings to me. I have asked other coworkers about her and they admit that even though she is not outwardly mean to them, she gives off a mean vibe. \n\nI honestly don't know what to do anymore to not get affected by her negativity. I feel like her negativity is making me a toxic person. Like somehow I want to one-up her since she wants to one-up me. I all of a sudden feel jealous of her. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M JEALOUS ABOUT! There's nothing that she has that I want, but I still feel this 'jealousy' towards her. I now want to be better than her at my job. I'm not like this with others. I have never been a competitive person (that's why I never played sports lol). I can't avoid her which is the worst part. I don't want to have these feelings of repulsion towards her. I send her love and pray for her but it feels fake of me to do that because I feel this repulsion.\n\nI know these are childish feelings and what's going on in the office is quite childish too. I am pushing 30 and I never thought I would feel like I'm in high school all over again. \n\nTL;DR- My coworker is giving off toxic vibes which has made me feel toxicity towards her. I don't want to have these feelings of toxicity towards her. I have tried to send love and pray for her but I still feel this repulsion towards her. I have meditated but I can't pin-point why this is affecting me so much. Meditation only works temporarily. I have thought about having a conversation with her, but I realized that some people may not be self-aware of their behavior (or admit to their behavior), and it may make things even more awkward. WHAT CAN I DO? I AM REALLY FRUSTRATED! ",

Generally I'm always looking at the positive side of things and I don't ever judge people, I just allow them to be. Being brought up how I was, it's taken some time to cultivate this amazing mindset that I have most of the time. But certain people in my life can be quite negative and very judgemental of others. I find myself sinking to their level. While I don't partake fully, I also don't shut it down because I'm scared of confrontation. And to be quite honest, if I were to shut down everyone in my life when they make a joke at anothers expense, I'd be doing it constantly and most likely end up with no one in my life. Which maybe is better?\n\nI'd love to have the courage to look at the people in my life and just say \"hey, I don't like talking about/judging/making fun of.. etc. other people and would appreciate if you didn't do that around me\" but usually when this happens or I'm around certain people, I feel myself go unconscious and when I'm unconscious I forget who I AM! And I just fall back into my old ways of laughing off uncomfortable situations. Maybe with more growth I'll get there but for now, how do I handle this? Keep my distance? Walk away? Run??? Force myself to speak my mind?\n\nAfter I typed all this out, I feel like I definitely know the answer to this.

I know I can, but I want to know from the people who have come from this route in life. If you KNOW and have this very similar path to me please enlighten me. I am very grateful for all of you. Would using psychedelics help me dream more? I wish to achieve this to spend time in the astral realm. So one can be in trueness and be able to help the rest when I go back to this realm.\n\nPeace, Love, Blessings, Abundance.\n\n\u270c\ufe0f \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u2695\ufe0f\ud83d\udef8",

I would like to test a theory saying that people who focus a lot on spirituality and raising the vibration individually and collectively, are mainly NF types in the MBTI type system, meaning INFJ, ENFP, ENFJ or INFP, but the ones that are answering the call of their hero\u2019s journey.\n\nMBTI is a type system, the deepest you ever saw, it took me a lot of time to validate it for myself, to be sure that this is not a scam, but once done I was fascinated how precise it is.\n(I am talking about the MBTI 8 functions theory, not about the simple 4 letters theory, which is just a simplification of the real theory, that is often considered inaccurate)\n\nMy theory is that this MBTI understanding shows that Earth wants to create a story through us, a story of life and love :)) you have 16 types separated in 4 families, in short, the ST and SF are the builders and guardians of society, NT are the technology makers and NF are the spiritual ones, the protectors of earth and humans. \n\nFor each type, there is an hero\u2019s journey, for example Robin Williams was ENFPs and he plays the role of an ENFP in almost all his movies. Expressing ENFP values. Each type have core values defined in patterns like chakras can be, there is 8 patterns, the ones that ENFPs use are mainly Ne Fi Te Si. What\u2019s amazing is that it also shows the unconscious part of someone and how we are the mirror of each other, it kind of pictures the oneness of all humans, how we are all connected. What\u2019s the most crazy also is that it proves the work of Joseph Campbell on myths, that we have all a hero\u2019s journey built in.\n\nHere is 2 tests to do to be almost sure of your type, 2 tests are needed to avoid biases that each test can have, and this is 2 tests made differently :\n\n- the classic test: https://www.16personalities.com/\n\n- and my test which go deeper: https://theherotest.involve.me/theherotest\n\nIf my test reaches the limit and doesn\u2019t work anymore, use this test instead: https://sakinorva.net/functions\nand give the result from the line \u00ab\u00a0grant function type\u00a0\u00bb.\n\nFYI: I am INFJ.",

Only recently I\u2019ve started welcoming some kind of spirituality in my life, and I feel there\u2019s a somewhat strong connection to a bigger picture, a bigger drawing. Since then, I\u2019ve started having incredibly vivid and realistic dreams about the same person. Now, I know this sounds crazy but I really need some advice and I don\u2019 really know who to ask. Keep in mind I have never spoken to this person, and they truly don\u2019t know I exist. Even back when I completely rejected any sort of spirituality, I still knew there was something between us and now I feel it even more, as they show up in my dreams so often. I always dream about us being together and being happy, and I don\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t even realize all this stuff until a couple of months ago, because I couldn\u2019t imagine myself getting such a huge crush (if that\u2019s what all this is) on someone I don\u2019t even know. Do I need to actually start opening up to the universe to open up my path for this person to come, or is it just me going crazy? Do you think there\u2019s any sort of meaning and reason behind this?

I only ever check when I have an urge and that day had been 111 days since my last self harm. Ever since, the frequency is increasing over time to the point I had 9!!! Pictures within 24 hours the other day. I opened up to my friend about it last night and immediately after I walk into the bathroom and there\u2019s a lady bug on my mirror. Probably doesn\u2019t need to be said, but this was super out of the ordinary. I\u2019m keeping it *safely* for now, might sound silly but I sat with it for an hour while it crawled around my hand and I felt like it was a spirit guide itself. (Don\u2019t worry, I had lady bug farms when I was younger so I know how to care for them) I have been working towards connecting back with my spirituality, but it has been tough due to depression. I\u2019m very happy to have these signs, but I desperately want to know what to do with them. Kinda stresses me out.\n\n\n Does anyone have any advice on how to get answers?\n\n\nAlso. Wanted to share what I saw earlier today.. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc I can\u2019t ignore it any longer \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/hjIZSI8",

When you don\u2019t feel deserving of positive change, you feel deserving of negative and/or no change.\n\n**Feeling insecure & unworthy of what you want, is feeling confident & worthy of what you don\u2019t want.**\n\n* For ex: *\"I am confident that my body is not good enough. I have a lot of confidence and certainty in my lack of self-esteem. I\u2019m confident that I\u2019m not capable of doing something. I\u2019m confident that I won\u2019t succeed. I am worthy of rejection. I deserve to feel unattractive. I deserve to feel guilty. I deserve to feel judged. I\u2019m good enough to be unappreciated. I\u2019m good enough to not be good enough. I am so worthy, I have the freedom to feel unworthy.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, the irony is: **You can only believe you're worthless, because you believe you're worthy.**\n\n**If you didn't actually feel worthy or capable of doing something, then you couldn't feel unworthy.** You believe you are worthy and deserving of being rejected and judged (as opposed to feeling worthy of love and acceptance).\n\nThe good news is, **you don\u2019t have to learn how to be confident or improve your self-esteem!** You naturally begin shifting the confidence and self-esteem you already have to what you want, by starting to care more about how you feel, and focus on anything that helps you feel a little better.\n\n* *\"I want to start feeling a little more confident and secure in what I want. I want to feel safe and supported. I like feeling appreciated and valued. I want to start being more compassionate and understanding with myself.\"*\n* *\"And I love cats! They\u2019re so cute. And clouds can be really relaxing. And, I want to start being more open to mutually satisfying relationships and connections. I want to start letting myself feel more comfortable and authentic in social settings. Wouldn't it be nice if I was 1% kinder to myself today? That's an improvement!\u201d*\n* ***\u201cI like knowing that I already feel worthy, confident, and have high self-esteem.

His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence.\r  \n\r  \nThe first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence.\r  \n\r  \nFinally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone.\r  \n\r  \nThe father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, \"You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe little boy then understood how powerful his words were. He looked up at his father and said \"I hope you can forgive me father for the holes I put in you.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Of course I can,\" said the father.\r  \n\r  \nIt's not always anger, it is your actions in general. There are no \"fresh starts\" in life. There is no new beginning. Forgiveness comes easy for many people but the scars of the past, they never go away. Watch what you do today, because sometimes the price isn't worth the reward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\~Source unknown\\~",

I have always felt very connected to the universe, and considered myself to be a spiritual person. I found peace in feeling connected to my soul, and never doubted that my soul would continue its journey after this body died. I also found comfort in some amazing experiences close friends of mine had with mediums. for the past year (as I finished my last year in university) I have been experiencing large waves of depression and hopelessness, paired with an extreme fear of no longer existing after death. Recently, it has caused me to feel severely detached from any of my old practice, and I\u2019ve been becoming increasingly afraid of death. Last night, I came across an article of scientists talking about how our brains can become so afraid of death that they make us fabricate things to help cope, and I think that was a final straw for my mind. I had a huge panic attack, and I can\u2019t shake this feeling that soon everything and everyone I love will just be gone, including me. Everytime I start to feel reconnected to my beliefs, i spiral and tell myself it\u2019s only because I\u2019m looking for comfort about my inevitable death. I hate feeling this way, I miss feeling attached to my soul. I don\u2019t know how find my way back, because everytime I do i just feel like I\u2019m only grasping for comfort about no life after death. Has anyone experienced something similar? What helped you find comfort, or reconnection? I\u2019m starting to become scared of my own brain, and my mental health it starting to decline.

The mind having no locus standi beyond the Mahat, such a state is the supra-mental state of the mind. In this supra-mental state, it is beyond the capacity of the mind to determine the principle of cause and effect, for further probings will entail the fallacy of infinite regress; that is to say, to think of the existence of the mind in a state where it does not exist is indeed fallacious.

          "content": "There's a pervasive problem in our world, and the cure to the inner conflict of the heart is found in Spiritual practice.  Spiritual practice allows a person to find Love (true nature) and Identity (were God is found).  Once these two are known, unity appears.\n\nOne of the greatest obstacles to this is the misidentified God of the Bible.  Earlier this morning, I outlined this for someone who was challenged by the nature of the Old Testament Lord.  His mind could see the obvious division between Jesus and the Lord of the Old Testament.  If you know and realize the Perennial Truth, you get why the Ego of the Lord was overcome by the Love of the Father of creation.  Even the Son of God had to fight the good fight.  Here is a reposting of the comment.\n\nAnyone who has deconstructed their former organized religious beliefs ask the questions that lead to Spiritual Love and Understanding.  One path leads us to the other once Ego is overcome with Love. This is the good news of the Lord and example of this truth.\n\nThis is the twist to the story you never expected.  God is Love.  Love is patient as we come to see ourselves by the nature of Love, not judgement and pride.  This perennial truth is in all religions.  Know Thyself.\n\n>All your questions on this topic are resolved when you recognize the perennial truth in all religions. Then, it's all clear. Yahweh is a personification of a ruler, power, throne, authority in us all called the EGO. Satan is the conscience, or accuser. My profile has a links page, and under the heading BIBLICAL LORD / ADAM'S EGO, you get the context outlined with every verse.  \n>  \n>When Yahweh realized his law and judgment were judging himself with self-righteous pride, he incarnated as Adam 2. Luke 3:38 tells you his secret identity as Adam. The Son of God (Lord) became a man to pay this price:  \n>  \n>6 Whoever sheds human blood,  \n>  \n>by humans his blood will be shed,  \n>  \n>because in his image, Elohim made humans.  \n>  \n>Now, the one speaking here is the true Father, or Elohim. Now go to 1 John 4 and read the true Father's attitude to judgment and fear.  \n>  \n>**18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.**  \n>  \n>**19 We love because he first loved us.**  \n>  \n>All of the Old Testament was the voice of a self-righteous accuser (devil), even if some of what he said is true. His heart was not true. Jesus called himself (the Lord of the Old Testament) the devil in John 8:44, or father of Israel. By being baptized (incarnated) into the cross (body), he becomes a new creation. The old things are passed away. Check Exodus 4:22-24 to see if Yahweh called himself the father of Israel and tried to murder Moses. He even lies to Pharaoh by telling him he will kill one son, then kills them all, including animals. Did Yahweh love the firstborn son's mothers? No. Only his own selfish goals were on his mind. EGO.  \n>  \n>Murder is not love. It's hate, judgment and the generation of fear in others. He flunks the fruit test, but rises to love as a man. According to jubilee laws, only a kinsman can redeem a kinsman. Unless he pays the cost of his bloodshed, he judges himself. By forgiving others, he chooses the true God and Father of Love.  \n>  \n>Perennial Truth over many books, many authors and many years of writing. This alone shows the authorship of the story overall. It's a shadow, not the living word. It's graven in the image of man, by man and for our realization of the true God. That God stands silent as we grow up and overcome the will to judge, better known as the Ego.  \n>  \n>**Revelation 3**  \n>  \n>**21 To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.**  \n>  \n>Overcoming EGO. Once you know, you cannot unknow. The only sin is pride, or self-righteousness proclaiming self to be God with none beside. Today, is he beside a God, at the right hand? Yes. Verification what I say is true.  \n>  \n>Don't judge him. WE are all him. The story is about us hanging on a cross (body) and incarnated into reality (baptism). Symbolism tells the story accurately. It's the perennial truth of every single religion of the heart, including Budhism, Taoism, Hinduism and all the rest reflected by the inner spirit to love others.  \n>  \n>It's both a way out and a way in. The Great News.\n\nWho are we as humans?\n\n>16 Don\u2019t you know that you yourselves are God\u2019s temple and that God\u2019s Spirit dwells in your midst? 17 If anyone destroys God\u2019s temple, God will destroy that person; for God\u2019s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.\n\nThe world needs to know this truth.  Could it be this truth sets us free from war; from judgment and hatred of others?\n\nThe past life of Jesus is more than we knew.  The Bible is the life review of God.  At death, will our own life review show the same Love of the Father for his Son?  Spirit is the Breath of Life in each person equally.  Watch your breath.\n\n&#x200B;",

So i had just gone through a huge moment of heartbreak, i wont go into detail but it sent me into a really bad depression the past year. so the day this happened i decided to get out of the house and take my dog on a walk through a cemetery down the street from my home. i was crying a lot and was just a mess. as i walked into the cemetery my dogs leash had gotten all tangled around my legs so i spun around to untangle it, and when i looked back in front of me a lady was approaching me and my dog. now at this point i have snot running down my face and my earbuds falling out of my ears and this lady she just talks to my dog. and we just sit there in the middle of the road in the cemetery. she made small talk like what my favorite song was and that kind of a thing. i figured she had just seen i was upset and wanted to comfort me. eventually a car pulled in the road we were sitting on so we moved to a bench nearby. we sat there for maybe 2 hours just chatting. but it was so odd to me because she was talking about all this spiritual stuff and it\u2019s hard to really remember it all now but i remember her saying if you look up at the sky, and you imagine saying \u201cfuck you\u201d to someone (basically being mean to someone) and that it\u2019ll come right back to you. so it\u2019s like saying fuck you to yourself. i\u2019m not sure why this stands out to me it just does. so once it got dark we said our goodbyes and we parted ways. and i remember as she walked away she lit a cigarette and she was just so elegant. and then she was just gone. and i was left in a shock i didn\u2019t know what to do with my self. and then she kept coming back. i kept seeing her around.. and every time i did it felt revolutionary to me. she always gave me good advice and a meaning to our conversations. we even went out and bought clothes together and explored places. or sometimes we\u2019d just sit in silence. there was something so comforting about this lady. she visibly had been using drugs and been homeless but i never questioned her or doubted her. i just talked with her and was there to keep her company. i remember a few times she mentioned her kids but i don\u2019t think she had seen them for awhile. i\u2019m not sure. there was something so pure about her that just really changed my perspective on life. she gave me a little charm once, she said \u201ci\u2019ve been holding onto this for awhile but i don\u2019t need it anymore\u201d , and she handed it to me. i still have it. she even shared a few of her favorite songs with me i still remember them. i just want to know what these interactions were. i was in the darkest place in my life when she stumbled upon me. i don\u2019t know what she was or who she was but i never seen her again after that summer. thank you for reading.",

Those who have got several pabula, run after all of them and in the end, get exhausted and get none. Running after the pabulum is known as e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1.\n\nIt\u2019s been told, \u201cAnanyamamata visnormamata brahamasamgata. \n\nInstead of running after several objects, run after Vi\u015b\u0144u and get Him because there is only one pabulum here. When more than one pabulum is there, the mind gets divided and none will be achieved. This goes on. \n\nWhen the e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is only one, the work will be done. When there are so many, the work will not be done at all. If one desires to take milk and smoke at once, it can\u2019t be possible. A man has to do either of these two. Hence the object of e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is Parama Purus\u0301a and nothing else.\n\nIn no case should humans be freed from e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1. Without e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 there will be disturbance. One has only to see the type of e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1. Where there is no e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1, there is annihilation of existence. Hence the existence of e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is essential. \n\nThe e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 for other objects has to be channelized towards Parama Purus\u0301a [Supreme Consciousness]. The correct e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is bhakti [devotion]. \n\nIf a man wants to become a devotee of the lord but in the mind of his mind, if he thinks that God will make him pass his examination \u2013 here the e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is not one but two. Here the work will not be done, \u201cI want Param\u00e1tman and from Him I want nothing\u201d. \n\nWhen something is demanded from God the e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 becomes two. Hence the time is completely wasted. Where this e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is towards Param\u00e1tman there it is known as devotion.When the e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is not for Param\u00e1tman but for something else, it is known as asakti [attachment].\n\nA s\u00e1dhaka [spiritual practitioner] who moves on speedily towards Parama Purus\u0301a will never be blind to the sufferings of numberless persons around him because of the lack of solid social system, solid economic system and the lack of humanity. If he is blind to the ill-management in the social system, he has not been able to understand Parama Purus\u0301a fully. When a devotee will move towards Parama Purus\u0301a his approach will be \u00c1tma moks\u00e1rtham jagat hit\u00e1ya ca [self-realization and service to humanity]. \n\nHe goes on moving towards Parama Purus\u0301a while serving the humanity. When the humanity is neglected, the \u00c1tma Mok\u015b\u00e1rtham [self-realization] is also destroyed. Hence he must be ready to serve the humanity.\n\n Therefore the s\u00e1dhakas who don\u2019t render social service don\u2019t have real devotion. In their devotion lies selfishness [Khudaparasti]. The devotees who are selfish don\u2019t attain God [Khuda]. Hence the correct e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is devotion. Those who are devotees are workers [Karmii]. They will never be afraid of the work. They will do maximum work. The Supreme Goal of human life is sam\u00e1dhi [merging of unit consciousness into Cosmic consciousness]. \n\nPeople are established in Shiva [Infinite Consciousness] sam\u00e1dhi by being guided by \u201c\u00c1tma mok\u015b\u00e1rtham jagat hit\u00e1ya ca\u201d. There is no other way out.\n\nShrii Shrii \u00c1nandam\u00fartiji \nparaphrased from Astitva and Shivatva\nSubha\u0301s\u0301ita Sam\u0301graha Part 20",

Different religions call it by different names and they believe that there is a divine essence that allows the body to go through this existence that we call \u201cLife\u201d from the moment we are born until we die, what happens then is not yet certain, in the course of our existence we meet people, we live adventures, we grow and learn, among the many souls with whom we happen to become traveling companions will establish bonds that may last for a day or forever, but what allows these encounters to be only casual or important? Who or what is it that makes us bond more with certain people than with others? It seems that the soul is capable of recognizing who is on the same wavelength as us, something that the mind is not capable of. Forty years have passed in this short adventure that we call \u201cLife\u201d and my body is beginning to show the first signs of rupture due to the inevitable expiration date that is part of this mystery that is the greatest adventure that we can live \u201cLife\u201d itself, two old friends have come to visit me and as always happens when we meet, time loses its importance, It stops, nothing seems to have changed since we were young and strong, our bodies have changed, aches, pains, intolerances, hair and beards a little gray, but the soul has not aged, the soul can not age but can accumulate experiences and mature, the soul is ageless and perhaps immortal, The Soul is capable of recognizing its fellows and with whom it is at ease, the body seems to be only a kind of shell that at some point will lose its usefulness and abandon us, but perhaps the Soul will continue in its adventure only under another form, I don\u2019t have an answer but I have no doubt that I have been fortunate to have met so many wonderful souls in these 40 years that have made this adventure a beautiful journey, I don\u2019t know when and how it will end but when my expiration date arrives I will be able to consider myself fortunate to have met special souls that have allowed this journey to be full of beautiful memories and unforgettable moments.",

Attachment means clinging to something or someone, becuase you found it fascinating, attractive, helpful, relaxing etc. all this is true in the sense of something, something dead ie your car, house, smarthphone, smoking, or anyother addiction. You are attached to a person, whether its a woman or a man becuase you have that feeling of loneliness. when you attached to someone, it brings fulfillment within you, or a sense of fulfillment within you. Not only that but it also comes with the anxiety, insecurities, fear, possessiveness, happiness, love, excitement, that creates the confusion of mind & heart. Its easy to get over when someone who don't wanna clinge to you or if she wants.but you are in the worse when the other person is on the fence. This creates a lot of confusion, you go through misery, and that feeling is the worse, it ruins your psychological state of mind. You have to pay a very heavy price just to be attached to someone. If you are attached, nothing works in this situation. you must have to face this situation no matter what. No understanding, no logical sense helps when you are attached to someone. Only time can heal these wounds. So, an intelligent individual, experience all these things, see the truth of it & get aware of all of these. He get that very sense from the very bottom of his heart that attachment only brings misery to his life. & he will never attached to something or someone in the future, becuase he is having this intense experience of attachment that brings misery, that makes him frightened when he even think of this. there is no way that one can go back to the same cycle and experience the same thing again. So, to summarize, if you are attached, there is no way going back from it, you must have to face it, you have to go through this misery. Feel the pain, feel that very psychological pain that it brings to you. Be hurt, physically and psychologically. Becuase it will become the base of your intelligece that won't make you attach ever.",

My siblings and I are very close and love each other very very much. My siblings keep me going and I know one of my purposes in life is to help take care of them and show them true unconditional, judgement-free love. \n\nBut I\u2019m so scared that someday I\u2019ll end up like my dad. I dissociate so much and I feel like my mind is so far to reach at times. I have a hard time remembering anything and I feel like I\u2019ve lost some of my intelligence now which makes me so sad. I space out and im sure the weed smoking doesn\u2019t help. I guess what im trying to get to is that I feel lonely and crave parental love. How can I reconnect with myself and my mom so I feel more like myself again? How do I remember the good memories instead of the bad?",

          "content": "Tasawwuf, commonly referred to as Sufism in the West, is neither a separate religion nor a sect within Islam. Tasawwuf can be described as the spiritual orientation of the heart in the pursuit of God. It thrives through practice, discipline, and diligence. Tasawwuf has its roots in Islam, with those closest to the Prophet Muhammad practicing it without formal nomenclature. Their primary sources of spirituality were the Quran and the Prophet's life.\n\nOver the centuries, many Tasawwuf practitioners and scholars structured its core practices into a formal discipline, giving it a name and developing a vocabulary to describe the spiritual journey, states, feelings, and phenomena. Even today, new terminology continues to evolve.\n\nSome Sufi scholars have gained quite a popularity in the West due to the availability of translated works. These scholars include Rumi, Ghazali, and Ibn Arabi. Unfortunately, nowadays, Tasawwuf often exists in name only, with its practices dwindling. Many people quote secondary or tertiary sources to make their points. While this has its place, it is crucial to strive for learning from primary sources.\n\nAs a spritual practice, tasawwuf is holistic, employing a variety of practices to aid the Salik (Seeker) on their journey. Commonly used practices include Zikr (Remembrance of God), Fikr (Reflection), and Muraqaba (Meditation). In tasawwuf, the meditation is not an end in itself, it is rather the means to the divine.\n\nA well-known Tasawwuf anecdote likens the spiritual path to climbing a mountain, where various trails exist. The person at the mountain's summit sees all trails. The Shaikh (Spiritual Guide) prescribes the best route for a Salik or Mureed (Determined Seeker). Thus, you'll find diverse practices within Sufi literature.\n\nFor those interested in embarking on this path, here are a couple of beginner techniques. You can start practicing some spiritual exercises today without converting or joining a Tariqa (School of Sufi Thought).\n\nGo for a solitary walk or a hike. With each step, silently invoke God's name, using the name you prefer (God, Allah, Dio, etc.). Say His name in your heart clearly and with focus; there's no need to be loud. As you walk, observe the workings of God's world. In nature, contemplate the winds, clouds, and the activities of birds. In an urban setting, reflect on the cycle of life\u2014birth, aging, and departure from this world. Everyone is busy with their roles.\n\nSaying God's name with each step is known as Zikr (Remembrance), while contemplating God's work is called Tafakkur (Contemplation).\n\nTry these practices and share your experiences.",

I thought that I was Jesus basically, and thought my family was out to kill me, poisoning my food, plotting on me in many specific ways. I thought everyone was demonic. I read the Bible but it only made it worse. I kept telling my dad that I didn\u2019t want help from people, I just needed God. Since then, I\u2019ve been really good at distracting myself. But now, the distractions are gone and I\u2019m on the brink of insanity. Mostly revolving around spirituality. I don\u2019t know who God is anymore. Or where to find him. I can\u2019t read the Bible anymore, it makes me more scared and doesn\u2019t speak to me how it used to. So many people have put their perspectives and opinions into my mind, I have no discernment at all anymore. It\u2019s like my mind has evaporated. I\u2019m like, numb. It\u2019s hard to talk about it out loud. Everything feels demonic, even me. I trust no one. I turned away from God in 2020 and haven\u2019t heard or felt him since. I\u2019m alone. Every sound, word, everything- is overwhelming and being twisted into something dark. Im having delusional thoughts but can kind of work through them. I\u2019m conscious of it but I\u2019m scared of losing grip again. Should I check myself into a mental hospital? I\u2019m literally supposed to work in the morning. This is torture. I have no peace.

Is anhedonia a byproduct of not having materialistic goals?\n\nMy 2 modes seem to be aching boring nothingness and utter despair. I wake up. I think \"what could/should I do with this day?\" And there is nothing. Have breakfast, wash, do a bit of cleaning, organising, stare out the window, at the wall. After being awake for an hour I've done everything I need to do and I could just go back to bed. Typically if I read, watch or listen to something I start falling asleep anyway. I've been stuck here for 5 years after a complicated loss.\n\nIt feels like the path of my life is the same of each day. I'm just waiting to sleep. I'm not chasing a dream. I'm not having children. I don't want to depend on stuff or events for peace or god forbid, joy. And I'm not shackling an innocent soul into this existence for my own sense of purpose.\n\nSomewhere I know life isn't about what I want. I should help people, or something. Volunteer. But I'm not reliable, even to myself. I've had multiple friends give up on me because I can't get out of the house when it's time to meet up. I usually manage one meal a day, the rest I pass on because I don't really feel worth the short time holding myself upright, making and cleaning up. Hunger isn't really that painful in comparison.\n\nI appreciate this is a jumble but if the crux of this rings any bells, and you have got to another side of wishing you didn't have to be here, what's a good place to start?

Suicide is a theme during these infrequent occasions and while I'm not remotely suicidal outside of these episodes, in those moments I contemplate it seriously (not as an immediate action, but more as a legitimate option at some undefined point in the future). \n\nHowever several times now, in the midst of a dark spiral of hopelessness, I have felt the most incredible love and comfort envelop me, putting an immediate stop to the despair. Like every cell in my body is infused with some essence of love. It happens immediately, like flipping a switch. It's not like my thoughts gradually get less dark and I work my own way out of the pit; I am suddenly lifted out and thereafter incapable of feeling bad even if I try. I can think the same thoughts that were, moments previously, like daggers to my soul but they have no effect. I am suddenly within an impenetrable bubble of love. It's happened 3 or 4 times now. It doesn't happen every time I'm sad or spiraling, but comes only in my very darkest of moments. \n\nAnyway I want to know if this remarkable energy is coming from God, a guardian angel, a departed loved one or, in my most hopeful of fantasies, a soul mate whom I've yet to meet but am connected to in another plane.",

Ever since then, I\u2019ve lived a life full of confusion, repetitive heartbreaks (I was the one doing the heartbreaking), self-destruction psychosis and delusion. A few times, I\u2019ve tried to connect with God again, only to fail, and turn out seemingly worse. I feel like I\u2019ve been locked out of heaven. Nothing interests me anymore, my guilt/shame/confusion leaves me hopeless and depressed and suicidal. I don\u2019t trust anyone, not even myself, I have no goals, no passion. I miss God but resent him at the same time. I have a heart of pain and emptiness. On top of my own mistakes, there is a great deal of trauma and pain caused by others. I want my light back. I want hope. Anyone relate or have advice on how to get through this ?",

I grew up going to a non-denominational church, so I guess I have experience with being religious even though Christianity never really clicked with me. I guess my concern is that I don't know where to start. I don't know where my identity would really fit in a way that isn't culturally insensitive or disingenuous, I guess. I feel like in America specifically, white spiritual communities are largely, well, white. I feel like this in of itself is contradictory of the inclusive practices that they are doing. I don't really know how to articulate what I mean but I guess where does one begin a spiritual journey when their identity has been historically discriminative of the very cultural practices I am trying to learn from.

Surely I am separate from  all these average people supporting Israel's latest bombing campaign in Gaza and spreading propaganda that has been repeatedly debunked without guilt. Surely I am separate from people who partake in history revisionism to justify the ethnic cleansing of my people. Surely I am made of something different than the people who do not flinch at the deaths of 20K people in the span of 2 months. Surely I will not end up in the same place as these people?\n\nIt's becoming so hard to cope with reality, and I've never really believed in the idea of heaven or hell, but recently I have been finding myself hanging on to this concept to continue existing as normal. I can't fathom that this is life. I can't come to terms with the fact that the filth I've been witnessing, as it is now more apparent than ever. It is seriously weighing down on me. \n\nIs hell real? If hell isn't real, are we in hell? If so, why is it hell for us and not for the politician being bribed to vote against a ceasefire? If not, will there be hell? Will these people feel the wrath of the terror they encouraged and provoked?\n\nPS: Please do not engage in a political debate with me. I am not here for this. I have my own opinion and the information is plenty and out there. I know the history of the formation of the Zionist Entity in detail, I have read countless of books from both Israeli and Palestinian historians, scholars, artists and other authors, I am of Levantine descent  and was raised by parents who were victim to the war crimes of Israel back in our ancestral homes, and I have had the misfortune of having to escape Israel's 2006 bombing campaign in Lebanon.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing what everybody thinks.",

The various socially constructed beliefs and structures would be the fictions of the 5th wall and the identities which exist in-between the various data points which are metaphysical(social constructs etc)and the ones which are \u201cphysical\u201d(genes, environment etc) is merely a character based on the relations between these data points. It is an approximation of unity between the various metaphysical and physical components. \n\nRealizing you are playing a character confined by delusions and misconceptions will show you the fiction of existence .",

But when the body dies, if we have not been enlightened with the truth that we are not this body that dies, we are not the mind and ego that carries karma birth after birth, if we do not realize this, we will return to earth in a rebirth. This is one destination and it happens for the majority of us \u2014 we just die and we are reborn. And this goes on and on. But very few people are blessed to be enlightened, to realize the truth that they are not the body, not the mind and ego. For such people, the destination is liberation. The destination is unification with the Divine; freedom from the cycle of rebirth, called Moksha or Nirvana, salvation, and becoming one with the Lord.",

What should one do when one feels lonely (physically amd mentally/spiritually)? I mean like for long times and I also don't mean superficial relationships. \n\nMaybe to clarify: I can spot and handle some of my desires to be unimportant so to say. Like for example wanting a new object like a new clothes/shoes/electronics or fancy foods etc. I have not a big problem to recognize this and not give in to those desires so to say. Fortunately I also have enough food, water, shelter and kind ppl around me. So I don't have a lack of those and an unmanagble desire for those things. But I am very lonely and very few not to say no close friends/a partner or something similar. And I feely my body and mind don't like that. My spiritual side has probably not so much a problem with it except that it doesn't know how to handle these deisres and the desperation and selfhatred and sadness that are caused by the fact that I see no chance of ever/or at least until now meet someone with whom I would have compatible chemistry.\nI also wonder, there are ppl whi never even can find colleagues or so, what would one recommend them to do?

I was really holding back as I didn't want to at that moment. I finally gave in cause I was just too tired to fight it and I thought maybe it was something I was being asked to do by my spirit guides. It felt really dizzy and I was pushed back to my body quickly. Wasn't peaceful at all.\n\nThen, tonight, as I was getting asleep, I started hearing in three different occasions (like being there in first person), a scene of abuse towards a woman, a bombing in civilian zone and another scene I can't really remember now.\n\nI'm not scared of these experiences but I'd like to know if it's normal and how could I help/manage if someone there is connecting to my energy.\n\nThanks in advance and excuse my broken English. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

Obviously it's wrong and bad, but eternity? Then I thought about and realized no matter how old the earth is, if the scriptures are true HE is older at least than those years, since HE created everything. Meaning eternity to us would more than likely be vastly different to him. So I wonder if we will all view time as HE does some day. If so, then that makes sense, because the punishment would simply be a punishment rather than torture. What are your thoughts on this? I feel like this should have been obvious, but its is a answer to a question I have just now received.",

          "score": 7,
          "author": "bobobrott",
          "content": "Are me (29M) and my girlfriend (27F) incompatible?\n\nMe (29M) and my girlfriend (27F) have been dating for 2 years, and now that a potential engagement is on the table, I've been doubting whether I chose the right partner. She's very practical and I have a strong spiritual side that I would like reflected in my partner.\n\n  \nNeither of us was looking for marriage when we first started dating so I didn't even have my antennas on for whether she's wife material back then. We wanted something casual originally but then feelings grew and we fell into a relationship and adapted to each other.\n\n  \nThe good thing is I was originally attracted for the right reasons - she's mild mannered, attractive, grounded in the real world, has a well-paying job like me, and we dream of a similar future.\n\n  \nHowever I always felt there was something missing for me - she sees the world through a very literal, logical lens, while I often like to sense things through my body/emotions, and I want to integrate more eastern teachings into my lifestyle. I've always swept this under the rug, but now I'm transitioning to a career in the wellness industry and I'm meeting a lot of people who experience the world in the same way as I do, and I realize it's a big void in my relationship and in my life that I've yearned for strongly.\n\n  \nI've tried to see if my girlfriend would be into spirituality , and she's open to taking some classes with me and supporting my journey, but it's not a core part of her identity like it is for mine. She understands when I break things down for her into scientific steps, but if I go into more abstract concepts like having her sense her awareness and the aliveness in her body, she has this clueless look in her eye unless I break it down like a math problem. And then at that point it becomes a concept rather than an experience.\n\n  \nI've often daydreamed about if a girl who's into Buddhism and yoga would be a better match for me, but I'm trying to talk myself out of it because I love my girlfriend and I don't want to abandon what we've built. At the same time I don't know if this relationship is what's best for me long term. I long for someone who values a lifestyle of self-awareness practices and co-creates an environment like that with me. I'm also less interested in sex with my girlfriend these past months because our sex is only physical. She thinks we can compartmentalize our careers and have external friends who share our interests, but I'm noticing I want spirituality to pervade into my relationship more and more.\n\n  \nIs this just a case of the halo effect/grass is greener syndrome, or could it be an actual incompatibility?\n\n  \nTL;DR - Dating for 2 years, considering engagement, but strong doubts arise. Girlfriend is very scientific, while I seek a more spiritual connection. Initially, I wasn't dating for marriage, and the practical aspects attracted me, but now I feel a void and diminished sexual attraction. Girlfriend is open to exploring spirituality but it's not a part of her identity and has hard time grasping it. I daydream of a partner into Buddhism and yoga. Unsure if it's a case of grass is greener or actual incompatibility.",

          "content": "My current partner and I have been together for about 2.5 years and honestly, about a year ago our sex life took a bit of a plunge. \n\nThat is not uncommon for me - every longer term relationship I\u2019ve had, has plateaued around the year mark and I\u2019ll usually break up with them around the 1.5 year mark because I feel nagged by them for wanting sex and I don\u2019t want it. \n\nI have been going through a big ol\u2019 healing journey this year though and have already begun to reap the rewards slowly but surely (better mental health, less avoidant, more clear-headed and grounded, protecting my energy etc) \n\nI hoped that I\u2019d see similar positive outcomes for my sexual appetite, but no such luck at all\u2026\n\nI recognise that I have more shadow work to do, but feel I need a push in the right direction. What should I focus on? What questions may steer me in the right direction?\n\nI love my partner very much, they\u2019ve been my rock since we began dating and it saddens me that I am not satisfying them nor myself. I find myself envious of others who have high sexual appetites, seem very much still into their partners sexually after years together, and am tired of repeating this cycle over and over again. \n\nSome things that may add some needed context:\n\u2022 I grew up with emotionally immature parents. \n(I did not receive consistent emotional support, my parents could not emotionally regulate causing me to become hyper vigilant, insecurely attached and deprived of emotional connection from a young age) \n\u2022 My parents very rarely showed intimacy toward each other from what I saw/see. \n\u2022 I have been sexually assaulted in my life. \n\u2022 Energy wise \u2014 Three separate times now, I have had a partner or just someone I\u2019ve had sex with before, seemingly try to have sex with me while they\u2019re sleeping. Like, I have been woken up by them either climbing onto me and trying to have sex with me or rubbing themselves on me incessantlyyyyyyy, and they have been completely asleep\u2026 The first time it was my boyfriend at the time and he was mortified and ashamed. The second time it was just a friend who was sleeping in the same bed as me (but we had slept together before) and he also seemed surprised by it - I concluded for him that he was a sketch bag and haven\u2019t spoke to him since! But, now that it has happened again with my current partner (and they were also shocked to hear it happened and seemed grossed out by themselves for doing that, and having no recollection of it) So, after a third time in my life - I feel like maybe something more is happening here energetically?? \n\nDoes anyone out there have any insight into this? What may be going on? How I might best go about working with my shadow on this? \n\nI feel like once my partners don\u2019t get as much sex from me, they become needy for it which repulses me even more and I lose attraction for them altogether. But, I genuinely want to break this pattern. I have had good chats with my partner about our sex life lots, they know about my history of sexual abuse and borderline emotional neglect as a child. They are a very patient, beautiful partner, and I love them and want to start a family with them one day. But, it\u2019s getting harder to truly visualise that now when we are having these issues that have been coming up for me for a longggg time\u2026 I don\u2019t want to lose my current partner because I am not finding my way to healing\n\nAll advice and anecdotes welcomed!",

Not just in the classic dismissal of hippies \u201cohh I love you all we are all the same in some way\u201d, but in a \u201cYOU ARE GOD/SOURCE\u201d way.  If you\u2019re heavily religious and choose not to consider other perspectives, time to click off this post. \ud83d\ude09 Maybe it\u2019s just too bad the universe is infinite and I constantly keep slipping into linear timelines/present moments in which everyone is ASLEEP \ud83d\ude34.(aka, the people who are confused/ call me crazy/ tell me to lay off the wacky-sauce in the comments.) These versions of myself I speak about actually believes that they are their body/ego/identity, and therefore fears death/ or feels the need to \u201cprepare\u201d for the terrible, terrible future to come. If that\u2019s you, so be it- that\u2019s your trip, man. Keep living that perspective if that\u2019s what you so enjoy- a fear based viewpoint. If only you would see that there are infinite \u201cparallel\u201d realities just as real as this one now. And it splits infinitely, depending on if it is \u201cobserved\u201d, and both universes are observed, creating the split. And subsequently, Wildly different variables go into the result of the linear world you are perceiving now. \n\n\nSo of COURSE God smites the whole world if it gets too bad, it\u2019s INEVITABLE due to FREE WILL & INFINITY. \n\nIn this way, what you BELIEVE will happen, WILL HAPPEN. It\u2019s all God. You are God. It is all One! The sacred books have been telling this us for years. We have the internet, and yet- no one feels connected to eachother. Do you not recognize the beautiful expressions of self in all the languages? Just because it\u2019s a different language/ culture doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s EVIL\u2026 (looking at you, Muslims, Christians)  Excuse my English.  I\u2019m done typing this out. By this point I\u2019m just expressing my frustration towards the versions of myself who try to call other people evil or going to hell simply for having a different way of life. Isn\u2019t that so comical. YOU ARE that other person. Why are you so blinded by your individuality? LOVE THEM. ACCEPT THEM.  (Still speaking to myself)\n\nThis multiverse will not be commonly known until later on. If you\u2019re reading this from the future, and quantum physics many worlds theory is somehow proved- then hello. (Which, it will happen. Since it\u2019s infinite. This is the way god woke. This is the way God is able to do miracles. Jesus was 5D and beyond, mf\u2019s. He let us off easy. We could put on a real show if we all believed and knew what we were capable of. But there\u2019s so many of us in this linear reality. So",

          "content": "# The Seeker and the mysterious Stranger (Part 3 of 7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Love will change the world**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cListen man, I want to be honest with you,\u201d the **Seeker** says to the **mysterious stranger**. Both are sitting on their bench, deep in a forest.\n\n\u201cYou know... I am tired... Utterly exhausted. Everyday, is a day of struggle. After every achievement, reality kicks in and I am crushed by Life. One challenge after the other. So many problems to fix, so many battles to win. Everything just seems... so shallow... so meaningless.\n\nFirst you go to school, then perhaps higher education, get a job, get married, raise your children, climb the career ladder, then your children move out, then retirement and after couple of years you die lonely in a nursery home... And I ask myself, is that all that there is to Life? A constant struggle to fit in with the expectations of society? Why do I still get out of bed everyday?\n\nLife has let me down, humanity has let me down. Whenever I read the news, I just get sad, angry or disgusted. Everyone knows how fucked up the world is... We are all aware of what's going on. All these terrible things happening... And I am just tired with it, that's all. Disappointed with life itself. And Yet, all I ever wanted is to be happy...\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe **mysterious stranger** looks at the **Seeker** with empathetic eyes.\n\n\u201cLet me ask you Seeker, if you had the power to change the world, what kind of world would you envision?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d answers the **Seeker**, yawning. \u201cPerhaps a world, that is peaceful, without any wars. Perhaps a world, free of environmental pollution. A world free of prejudices and biases of any kind. A world of joy and laughter. A world of bliss. A world of Freedom and unity. Where we share our food, instead of fighting over oil. I just want a world, where I can be myself without being judged or taken advantage of. A world, that allows me to be happy.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cLet me tell you a secret,\u201d the **mysterious stranger** grins. \u201cEveryone dreams of such a world. Doesn't matter where they live, doesn't matter what they do. On the deepest level, this is what all of us actually want. Even those who are fully consumed by hatred... Even they long deep within, for such a world.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe **Seeker** scratches their forehead:\n\n\u201cBut... If everyone supposedly dreams of such a society, then explain to me, why we are unable to change it.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cThat is a very long story,\u201d the **mysterious stranger** smirks.\n\n\u201cI will tell it to you, when you visit my hut. But for a short answer: We don't change the world because we don't believe, that we can. We think it's impossible... Because this is all we ever knew. But what if I tell you, that ***there is a way***? What if I tell you, that it is in fact possible. Close your eyes and imagine it. Can you see it? A world, where people are dancing on the street, singing a song of liberation. A world, where old enemies drink together as friends. Can you hear the song, that resounds deep within the heart of every human being? Can you feel it? The wind of change blowing into your face.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe **Seeker** blows some air from their nose. \u201cTss... And how do you suppose, we achieve this? Through a revolution? We all know how well this worked out in the past... Or do you propose a reformation, a couple of social programs... You think, this will change the world?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe **mysterious stranger** burst out in laughter:\n\n\u201cCertainly, this won't change anything. You can't fight violence with violence. You can't fight separation through further separation. No, you can't change the world through any ideologies or political action.\n\nNow what is it in ourselves, that is needed most in these times? What is it, that can wipe away all of our tears, all of our suffering, our anguish and our hate... What is it, that can break the cycle of destruction? What is it, that can free us from the prison, that we ourselves have created?\n\nThe answer, my friend, is LOVE. ***LOVE will change this world***. LOVE is a force that cannot be stopped. All shadows vanish, when you shine the light of love on it. You can't grasp it, it is neither yours or mine. LOVE is there for everyone and anyone. \u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cLove?!\u201d The **Seeker** asks in disbelief. \u201cThis is like the most stereotypical answer you can give. How should love itself transform the world?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d admits the **mysterious stranger**. \u201cIt's not that simple. You see, throughout the Ages, the meaning behind the word 'Love' was corrupted. Wrongly defined by many. We have lost it a long time ago. I say, it's about time, that we find it again. Love in its purest form. Once you have found it, you will understand. And you will see the power in it. You will see, the ripples that it sends out, from person to person.\u201d\n\nThe **Seeker** shakes their head, laughing. \u201cYou are spouting nonsense. I have never before heard such bullshit in my life. It won't make any difference if a single person changes. The world will remain fucked up.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe face of the **mysterious stranger** lights up in excitement:\n\n\u201cDon't you see it, my friend? Your influence on the collective is so much greater, than you can even imagine. Your thoughts, emotions, words and actions affect your entire sphere of influence, which is interconnected with the rest of the world. One light flaring up can suffice, to illuminate an entire room. LOVE may be hard to find, hard to see, as we are all so caught up in our prisons and illusions. But it just needs one person, to find true, unconditional Love... If one person changes their outlook on life; this will reflect on the collective consciousness. Change yourself and you change the world. ***For you are the world and the world is you.***\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cUtter bullshit,\u201d the **Seeker** spouts.\n\n\u201cIf I behave compassionate, someone else will take advantage of me. If I don't take what I want, someone else will take it. If I show weakness, I will lose. So why should I give up my sense of self, if this leads to regrets? Even if I were to 'transform' myself, there is always someone out there to hurt me. I have been hurt enough in my life to know, what humans are capable of.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cPlease tell me, dear Seeker,\u201d the **mysterious stranger** asks in a serious tone. \u201c***Why are you so afraid of love***?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TO BE CONTINUED**\n\nfor more content visit: r/We_Are_Humanity",

There are periods where I stop doing that, and just accept that it is her path to walk and not mine, and all I should do is just love her. Unfortunately those times go quickly, and I go back to trying to fix her situation when she doesn't ask me too. Funny enough, this exhausts me, and I build resentment toward her for something she didn't even do. She can notice this. We have had arguments about it and every one we have makes it seem perfectly clear to the both of us that it is my problem and not hers. I often bottle things up, until they come out and wreck havick.

Always ignored the signs because she give me that addiction of still wanting her after the downs.\n\nBefore the relationship I was in a really good mental state but my friend always told me to learn gratitude and self love. During the relationship I actually lost everything because my mind was addicted and I had alot of options to get out but for some reason it was not possible because I was addicted without me knowing.\n\nNow 1 good year after the relationship which was hard I started with the gateway tapes because someone told me the benefits of it, it helped me to get rid of that addiction and havent touched weed or alcohol for a good 8 months. Now switched to meditating sometimes with the tapes or with binaural beats. But know I want to learn more about gratitude and self love, I know there are alot of books.\n\n Which ones are recommended? Someone told me about the law of one but I cant find the right one only an anniversary edition of 85 euro\ud83d\ude43",

          "content": "Souls\nBy Alessandro Carosi\n\n\nWhat allows our body to move, feel emotions, love? Different religions call it by different names and they believe that there is a divine essence that allows the body to go through this existence that we call \u201cLife\u201d from the moment we are born until we die, what happens then is not yet certain, in the course of our existence we meet people, we live adventures, we grow and learn, among the many souls with whom we happen to become traveling companions will establish bonds that may last for a day or forever, but what allows these encounters to be only casual or important? Who or what is it that makes us bond more with certain people than with others? It seems that the soul is capable of recognizing who is on the same wavelength as us, something that the mind is not capable of. Forty years have passed in this short adventure that we call \u201cLife\u201d and my body is beginning to show the first signs of rupture due to the inevitable expiration date that is part of this mystery that is the greatest adventure that we can live \u201cLife\u201d itself, two old friends have come to visit me and as always happens when we meet, time loses its importance, It stops, nothing seems to have changed since we were young and strong, our bodies have changed, aches, pains, intolerances, hair and beards a little gray, but the soul has not aged, the soul can not age but can accumulate experiences and mature, the soul is ageless and perhaps immortal, The Soul is capable of recognizing its fellows and with whom it is at ease, the body seems to be only a kind of shell that at some point will lose its usefulness and abandon us, but perhaps the Soul will continue in its adventure only under another form, I don\u2019t have an answer but I have no doubt that I have been fortunate to have met so many wonderful souls in these 40 years that have made this adventure a beautiful journey, I don\u2019t know when and how it will end but when my expiration date arrives I will be able to consider myself fortunate to have met special souls that have allowed this journey to be full of beautiful memories and unforgettable moments.",

          "author": "NecessarySocrates",
          "content": "I used to think that Buddhism was so lame because of the idea of \"letting go of desire\". Like how exactly am I supposed to enjoy life if I don't want to do anything?\n\n\nBut it's not desire that's the problem, it's the *attachment* to desire. We're addicted to desire because from a young age we get beaten down by external forces in the world that are beyond our control, and then our default state becomes unhappiness, and then we learn to require external things in order to momentarily satisfy our egos and become temporarily happy. *Healthy desire* arises once we realize that our default state is actually *supposed* to be happiness, pure happiness and peace, and we can then act from this place of internal happiness to enjoy the world and seek the things we're truly interested in from a place of abundance and genuine excitement rather than desperation and scarcity. Others will sense our positive genuine attitude and be attracted to it. It's like the \"law of attraction\", in a sense.\n\n\n\"Letting go of desire\" is the act of observing your own ego from a higher vantage point. It's understanding that your emotions are just temporary worldly feelings and there is a higher plane of awareness and understanding from within where you can control these emotions so that you don't have to be a slave to them. \"Letting go\" is simple, but it's not easy. You really have to sit with your own emotions and take a deep dive to try to understand where they're coming from. Mindfulness meditation and therapy have helped me a lot with this.\n\n\nUltimately it's important to understand that even though we're all just flawed apes, we have the capacity to observe our own egos from a higher plane of understanding. Call that \"plane\" whatever you want... The Absolute, God, Brahman, Allah, Yahweh, the Universe, whatever, but understand that no matter happens in this physical world, there is always peace in this purest form of consciousness that your mind can tap into. After all, the purpose of life is to experience it and enjoy it, not to be a slave to your worldly ego. Hope that all makes sense.",

She doesn\u2019t know if she has or not because she doesn\u2019t talk to that side of her family. \n\nI believe this loved one was trying to get a message across but I don\u2019t know what it was or how to communicate on behalf of my co worker. \n\nCan someone help me understand this dream",

If I try to control the flow I was able to move until the solar plexus and never felt the flow at the root. However, I felt a lot of twitches around the base if I focus on the root.\n\nThird month, the head vibrations got very intense. I could feel the sensations/vibrations all over my head. Especially at the crown and throat back of my head. After 20 mins into meditation, I get strong pull on my head all the way back that face the ceiling and then very extensive pull on my neck as if it wanted to enlarge the vocal. Since I take a back support, I couldn\u2019t go much further back. After few mins, it\u2019ll slowly pull me to the front and make me look down and leave there for few mins.\n\nAnyone going through a similar journey? What should I expect next? What would you recommend me to do additionally?\n\nThank you.",

It felt wrong to just sit, I bowed my head and meditated. But, my headphones didn\u2019t cut out. \n\nAfter a while I figured it was just some stupid thing, and went to leave. But first I looked up at the sky. \n\nThe shape of the hill had been cut out of the cloudy night sky, even weirder was that directly above me, the shape of the groove has been cut out of the clouds. \n\nOn one end of the hill in the sky there was the shape of a person, and directly opposite them was a dog, I was with my dog since I walk her to this park every night.\n\nAt first I didn\u2019t notice this part, but off to the side there were two other shapes, two horned people. One had two heads and was holding a sickle, and the other had two horns, but it was only half a person, one horn was floating. Positioned between the creatures and the hill was the shape of a bow and arrow, which was pointed at me.\n\nThe sky was otherwise covered in clouds, and these shapes weren\u2019t there only two minutes before I got there.

I went through a bad breakup in which i had been cheated on my whole relationship. i had two abortions. i was struggling a lot. I even had to end my friendships because they just didn\u2019t align with me anymore. I had been taking life really serious as in putting work into healing. I transformed my entire life. I\u2019m now pescatarian, i work out 4 days a week, journal, meditate, sun gaze, take care of my mental health, quit social media, even went celibate and quit smoking. I get to school and it\u2019s temptations all around me. I started smoking occasionally then i started smoking a little more. A guy i had said a few words with at the gym came to me at the dining hall and asked for my instagram but i didnt have any and he kinda was acting like it was foreign to not have any socials and that should\u2019ve been my first sign. Then he asked to come over and he offered to smoked. We hung out the first time and just chilled. The second time we hung out we had sex. I cried after. I was so devastated i broke my celibacy.i woke up and i told him we needed a break from having sex cus i literally woke up depressed and i think i absorbed his energy and he said \u201cWe can stop having sex but who\u2019s depressed?\u201d I was just like\ud83d\ude10. Anyways i guess my question is\u2026 do you possibly have any words of wisdom for me or like any advice on just sticking to my path and staying single. I have a huge issue with hyper sexuality and risky sexual behavior. and i just felt like i fell back into old patterns i thought i already grew out of. i just want advice.",

What would YOU do in this situation?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to learn from a new teacher I've found, because I believe the info he's sharing may be helpful for continuing my growth (spiritual, etc.).\n\nHowever, I keep having misgivings about the person based on his attitude and the attitude of his associate who he creates content with.\n\nTo be frank, something about him just bothers me. I don't agree with cancel culture and the modern sport of being offended by everything, but part of me finds this person offensive enough to give me moderate pause.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**He sometimes comes across, for lack better terms, as potentially racist, ableist, and anti-feminist. And maybe even a bit arrogant? I know, I know, none of these things are crimes.**\n\n**Note: I'm not claiming that he is any of these things, but what I have heard from him and what I've read that he has written leads me, personally, to these conclusions.**\n\n**Another note: I'm no social justice warrior. I just think people should be treated with decency unless they do something to warrant otherwise.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to \"expose\" this person in anyway.\n\nI feel my issues with the things he says are personal. I'm not trying to shame anybody here. In fact, I could even be wrong in my assessment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But I will say that in a communication he sent today, he used the \"r\\*\\*\\*\\*d\" word to describe another human being who he considered \"mentally challenged\".**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't believe the use of this word alone is a huge flag (depending on how and why its used), but I'm adding this word choice to other things that he has said, and my own general feeling of *ugh* that I get from him.\n\nEXTRA DETAILS, SKIP IF YOU WANT: Now why do I get an *ugh* feeling? I suppose... I feel like he acts as part of a \"club\" that requires \"immutable\" characteristics to join. Further, people who aren't part of that \"club\" are inherently valued as less than \"club members\".\n\nDid that make any sense? Here's another example: I think it could be possible, that if I were to become his student and say, join in a zoom class with my camera on, he might--just might--treat me differently than, for example, a man, or someone who may look or act the way he does, and who therefore has better automatic rapport with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Also, I have tried to seek out the techniques that he's sharing elsewhere, but I have not found a workable alternative source.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this matter?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Is this a case of get in, get what you need, and get out?\n* Could the reservations that I have possibly mean that I need to stay far, far away?\n* Perhaps I'm just seeing the situation wrong or reading into things that aren't there?\n\nEXTRA DETAILS, SKIP IF YOU WANT: I had a short correspondence with him once and I found a comment that he had made to me to be what I considered... borderline offensive? I can take dirty jokes. After years of hearing such jokes and other double entendre, I can make a few of my own. So I'm no snow white angel here. But with email correspondence, nobody has ever made such a comment to me, and I've had correspondences with many, many other people. Never been told anything like that before and it made me feel \"ugh\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I really want to learn the information he teaches. Otherwise, I'm 98% sure I would have already completely distanced myself.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think? What would you do in this situation?\n\nThanks for reading.",

Suddenly I felt coming back\nto a normal state because I also fell in love with my current boyfriend. The normal feeling lasted a year and then I was hit by a giant depression that made me suicidal again  and I started seeing a shrink who prescribed me fluoxetine, which saved me. I started practising yoga and I was feeling so good that I pursued a dream I had: becoming a yoga teacher. I finished my training now. I stopped taking fluoxetine 1 year ago because me and my doctor thought I was able to go off. I had a normal year, kinda numb but stable and now I am feeling more and more depressed every day. It makes me worried because I know that this state was the beggining of all my heavy depressions.. I have my spirituality process now but even that is making me depressed. I turned 26 a few days ago, I am unemployed, am unemployed artist since I graduated which is tiring. My friends are boring. Everything is boring and I dont know what to do.

Same room we have as our room to be specific. So already there\u2019s a pretty high chance of spiritual activity. We know for sure there\u2019s loads of spirits on this property. I\u2019m a medium but haven\u2019t learned to much about how to control it and work with it to be of much help here. There\u2019s a couple spirits that hang out in the house and i do believe one is his. It\u2019s for sure a male 25-30 or so but that\u2019s all i know. He passed at 34 so i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s him. We have items get moved, fall, random headaches, tapping on windows, vultures outside, electronics turn on and off randomly, dead animals at our door occasionally just all kinds of signs of spirits but nothing directly harmful. \n\nHere\u2019s the question! I was cleaning today and lit some incense (dragons blood to be specific) and instantly got a huge migraine. Could the spirits be part of the reason why? Are they upset i did that maybe?

          "content": "I've been interesting in Spirituality for about 14 years. I've always been fascinated by such topics and everything. One thing that really bums me out is that I'll probably never be able to have any type of spiritual experience due to having aphantasia. \n\nFor those of you that don't know what aphantasia is it's the complete lack of a mind's eye. If I do have a mind's eye it's completely blind. For example when I read a book I only see words. I can understand what's going on and such but it all just reads like data to me. The book doesn't turn into a movie. I don't even have pictures or anything show up just words. I've done many guided meditations over the years and when they say things like \"visualize yourself on a beach\" I don't have anything come up. When I meditate all I see is blackness and there is an abyss of never ending thoughts. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if I didn't have severe ADD and rumination on top of this. \n\nIt's just annoying how most spiritual stuff requires visualization and imagination when I don't have that. I tried lucid dreaming and astral projection for countless years and never got anywhere with it. The furthest I got was the rare 30 second dream that was very random and hard to make out. I've been trying to do manifesting for so many years. I've been following Neville Goddard and everything and trying out his techniques but none of them work for me. \n\nDue to having aphantasia anything spirituality related is going to be impossible. I'll never get to astral project, never going to lucid dream, never going to channel, and never going to be able to manifest. For me I'll never get to do anything of this sort aside from reading about it. I know people are going to say that spirituality is more than those things and that is true but still it's annoying that due to my condition I'll never be able to do any of this stuff. I'm to the point where I will probably just throw in the towel and live life as it is and not worry about anything spiritual. I suppose if the spirit world is real I can at least experience spirituality on the other side when I pass on. ",

          "author": "daniel_shkolnik",
          "content": "Over a year ago, I went through what I can only describe as an awakening experience, otherwise known as a \"spiritual emergence.\"   \nPopular spiritual notions of \"awakening\" make it seem like it's the best thing that could possibly happen to you. What they don't mention is the psychological turbulence of premature awakening.  \nAwakening is not about becoming morally perfect, healing the sick, or becoming all-knowing. Awakening is simply realizing our true nature: the felt sense that we are the cosmos, and the cosmos is us. This truth opens our heart to flowing love. It liberates us from our cramped personal identities. We become capable of immense compassion, free from attachment, and directly connected to the sacred nature of the universe. It is the central teaching of all mystical traditions.   \nBut truly believing\u2014and living\u2014this truth can be frightening and destabilizing.   \nA spiritual emergence can lead to what Stan Groff called a \"spiritual emergency.\"In an attempt to make sense of my own experience, I began seeking out and speaking to people who have had awakening experiences.They are far more common than I previously thought, and they can be far more challenging and destabilizing than I imagined.  \nThree people I spoke with entered into psyche wards as a result of their awakening. One person experienced weeks to months of debilitating, nightmarish disillusionment. Saeed Khan, a consciousness teacher I spoke with, described how his awakening led to a prolonged state of clarity, after which he fell into intense depression before stabilizing himself. (I've had my own struggles integrating my experience, and I am grateful to Saeed and a few close friends for supporting me in challenging moments.)  \nSaeed introduced me to the term \"stable awakening,\" and I feel like that hits the nail on the head. Stability is what's missing in discussions of awakening, and in the global spiritual culture more broadly.Moving forward, I am committing to speak openly and clearly about my experience of awakening. This is for two reasons:  \n1. Living from a place of awakened consciousness may be the single most important shift we can make in our lives and for our world.  \n2. This shift can be immensely confusing and difficult without support.  \nThe mental health system (and psychology in general) aims to create ego-stability. It has virtually no frameworks for ego-transcendence, and as a result pathologizes awakening / emergence. According to Christina and Stanislav Grof:... many of the conditions, which are currently diagnosed as psychotic and indiscriminately treated by suppressive medication, are actually difficult stages of a radical personality transformation and of spiritual opening. If they are correctly understood and supported, these psychospiritual crises can result in emotional and psychosomatic healing, \\[and\\] remarkable psychological transformation.   \nPsychology tries to strengthen and secure the ego. And while strengthening the ego is a valuable first step to transcending the ego, it only gets us so far.   \nAs a result of my experience, a focus of my work has become studying and helping others achieve stable awakening or stabilize an awakening they're already going through.I've helped several people navigate difficult awakening experiences. In particular, those who come from non-religious backgrounds or who may not seek out traditional Buddhist, Hindu, or non-dual religious teachers. I am not a spiritual master, but I can offer psychological and spiritual tools that will better prepare people for and stabilize an awakening.  \nIf you or someone you know is going through a difficult awakening experience and are looking for some help, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to be a resource for those who need it. I can also connect you with other enlightenment teachers, like Saeed and others, whom I've worked with and trust.  \nAs Ram Dass said, 'we are all just walking each other home.'  \n",

This was one of the most memorable patients for me professionally and personally for the vast amount of love that was shared between the family and myself.\n\nI worked in an AIDS inpatient unit very early 1990s.  One patient was a lovely woman who had given the disease to her husband and 1.5 year old son.  The mother was so sick and treatment was so scarce for the disease back then it was a death sentence.  There was a 5 year old daughter that tested negative and was to be the only member of that family to survive so the mother, so sick, did what she could to spend time with her daughter to have memories of her mom as she grew up alone.\n\nThat mother was a saint, I'd have to give her so much medication for nausea so every day after school the daughter could eat with her mom.  Mom died very quickly, then the little boy then then father.  The girl went to live with her grandmother.  Our AIDS unit closed due to funding and I moved on to another Hospice working with terminally ill children.  I worked night shift and when I came in one evening I was told we had a little girl with AIDS, my mind went back to this family years ago.  When I walked into her room I recognized the grandmother and there in the bed was the little girl that was to survive as she tested HIV negative, she had converted later.  Testing was still in its infancy at that time.\n\nThe little girl told me to let her cat in the room.  Her grandmother said she had no cat, but the girl insisted Oscar was waiting for her outside the glass door.  I opened the door and in came a black cat, jumped up on the bed and curled up with the little girl.  The grandmother said she had no cat.  It was Hospice, she loved the cat and the cat loved her so we let Oscar stay.  He would come every night and leave in the morning.  I had such a strong feeling this was not just a cat but some strong spiritual being there to comfort the little girl, now the last of her family dying.  I even spoke to the cat, \"you're not a real cat are you?\"  I'd get a strange and wise look from Oscar and felt that I was in the presence of pure love.  Was this an angel, her mother, both???\n\nThe night she died, shortly after midnight, Oscar stayed with her just a few minutes after she passed then left, he never came back, we never saw him before or after.  I think Oscar was there to help the little girl through the tough transition into her next life, and left with the little girl's spirit.  What an honor to be in that presence.   Over the years I was the Hospice RN for all 4 family members on the day they died, mom, dad, baby brother and the little girl.  The love that family shared, that incredible mother, made be a better nurse for the rest of my career.  Over 30 years ago and I still think about this family every day.  I hope I have an Oscar when my time comes.  David Parker, Phoenix, Az.\n\nI speak better than I write so I just recorded this story in completion.  I'm retired now and want my experiences to be shared so they may uplift others.    I hope it's ok to post it here.\n\n[https://youtu.be/9coxdRkvBBk](https://youtu.be/9coxdRkvBBk)\n\n&#x200B;",

For the spiritual student, Shadow work is about knowing how to live an authentic life. For the practitioner, Shadow work is about recognizing your Ego exists, knowing what it looks like and how it functions, so you know how step outside of it in order to receive energy and messages through your higher consciousness. \n\nTo perform any spiritual workings, for instance, past life work, shamanic healing, reiki, the lesser ritual of the pentagram, mediumship or divination, it is necessary to recognize and side step the Ego so you can receive or transmute energy from the spiritual plane without filtering it through your own physical lens.\n\nIt is easy to recognize when we are acting with or from Ego. Any emotion or action that has a hierarchy or vanity attached to it has egoic root. Again earthly pursuits must be Egoic for many reasons, but spiritual pursuits must not so that your intention can work with the law of resonance in the capacity of your aim. \n\nShadow work is never done, even for the most adept practitioner.

          "score": 2,
          "author": "Sarphyz",
          "content": "Here I want to share my experience of the spiritual path and inner realization of the higher self. We have the ability and power to transcend any lower self. Only the Conscious you/higher self part of one is real, all lower selves are unreal and can be transcended anytime by reaching for a higher understanding and awareness of reality. The spiritual path is about letting go of lower selves one by one and step by step until the clouds part and your higher self shines through you. The higher self is like a diamond that cannot be touched by anything in this world, as it is of higher vibration and is transparent to the lower vibrations in this world. The lower selves are like a cloud surrounding the diamond and obscuring its vision of reality . The cloud is a conglomerate of selves and is what is collectively known as the ego. Each lower self is based on an illusion about reality that one came to accept in the past or in a past life. Dispersing the cloud and letting the lower selves die is a creative process not a mechanical one, it requires creative aware decisions of seeing the illusion for what it is and letting it go. The lower self is like a mindless computer program made of lower vibrations that have only a temporary fleeting existence and have no permanency and is not allowed in higher realms. It also has no self awareness and is like a pattern that keeps repeating until you step out of it, separate yourself from it, see that it is not you, and let it die. There is no state of perfection on earth and as long as one is still on earth there is always a lower self to look at and let die, to be reborn into a higher state of consciousness.\n\nThere is no other way to salvation than the path of oneness, of seeing who you are as a spiritual being that is connected to all other beings and to all life, and to stop identifying with the lower selves that are based on the consciousness of separation and duality. In oneness, one clearly sees itself as a connected being, that hurting another being or another part of life will hurt itself at the same time. The ego and false teachers want people to believe that there is a mechanical way to salvation without giving up the ego and its many illusions, by living up to a certain outer standard as a free ticket to heaven, without doing the dirty work of cleaning up one's own consciousness and facing their inner demons, while the true measure is the inner light and vibration, which is something that cannot be measured by any outer rules, but can only be known from within through intuition by connecting to one's own higher self. This underlying energy reality is the real essence of things and is what speaks louder than any words, actions or outer appearances. We are constantly interacting at the subconscious level with the energy fields and auras of the people around us and with the environment. Discernment through intuition is crucial in navigating this dense energy realm where one can be as Jesus said \"wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\u201d Any outer approach or teaching is just a tool to reach the inner path and one's own direct connection to God, which is always there and can never be lost, but can be clouded by the illusion of separation from God and all creation. People can be from different religions or spiritual movements, do different outer practices and even describe the same truth with different words but still have similar inner experiences of connecting to God and a similar purity of the heart and self transcendence, and that is what matters, not the outer approach but the inner result.\n\nWe can choose the teaching that suits us and resonate with us and there is no size fit all, however be aware of any teaching that claim to be the ultimate truth or discourage you from looking into other teachings, or form a cult, this can come obvious as claiming that those belonging to a certain group or teaching are special above others, and sometimes it can be subtle even in many new age movements where eventually, sometimes even without consciously recognizing it or declaring it, they form a collective spirit of feeling superior above others like many other traditional religious movements. This is an example of the many ego games and illusions that makes people believe that by simply being born into a particular place or religion or conforming to a certain outer standard based on physical appearances, they have a special status and will automatically be saved without cleaning up their own consciousness and seeing the equality of all beings. This gives them a false sense of security where they think they can take this illusion up with them in the ascended realm and save the ego, while by its low vibration it can never cross over to a higher vibrational realm. This way the ego is seeking to save the lower self created from the consciousness of death, by using the same consciousness that created it, it is seeking to solve a problem by the same state of consciousness that created the problem. This is the false path offered by the ego and false teachers and the main advantage it offers is that people need not to take responsibility for themselves and their own state of consciousness, but let some outer authority determine what they need to do in order to guarantee their salvation and their entry into a higher state of consciousness. Only the Conscious you has the ability to step outside of this ego game and pattern and see that there is more to life, more to you than any lower game.\n\nUsing an outer teaching can be especially important in the beginning stages of the spiritual path, as one needs a frame of reference beyond duality to walk the path to eventually be able to find the answers from within. In addition, invoking spiritual light through for example prayers can help disperse the energy and makes it easier for one to see through a certain illusion and surrender it, this is the alpha and omega aspects of walking the spiritual path, which is transmuting the misqualified energy into a higher vibration, and then letting go of the lower self that is generating the lower vibrational energy in the first place.\n\nWe are all equal sons and daughters of God each with their own individuality and uniqueness. You need nothing and no one outside yourself to be whole and worthy, you just need to accept it. As Jesus said \u201cthe kingdom of God is within\u201d and realizing your true inner diamond is the true joy that is unmatched by anything in this world and does not depend on any outer conditions but is an inner process. In oneness, the illusions of duality simply fall away. For example in uniqueness there is no competition, you can only be better than you were yesterday, more of who you are, more than before and all subsequent suffering springing up from the illusion of superiority or inferiority for that matter simply falls away.\n\nEarth is a difficult and dense planet because the collective consciousness is low, as is reflected by the many lower manifestations that act as a mirror to the state of collective consciousness. Jesus, Buddha and many other enlightened beings wanted to be an example not an exception. We all have this inner diamond that is who we really are, and we have the ability and power to disperse the clouds obscuring it that is made of the lower selves. It is inevitable that when one move away from oneness, their vibration will go down, this is a low that can never be changed by anything in this world and no matter what outer appearances one puts. The underlying energy laws of God are uncompromising, and it is a true mercy that secures your freedom. For example, the illusion of men or women either one being superior to the other springs from the ego attempts to use an outer appearance to elevate itself and then feed on other people's energy through control and fear, which is the main mechanism of its survival. But the reality is that the yin and yang come in harmony and complement each other, instead of compete with each other, and only when they come in harmony that the energy of the place thrives and abundance follow. These energy flows can never be changed no matter what games the ego tries to hide behind. Because of free will, people can choose to go against the laws of love and harmony, otherwise they are not free. The law of karma is an expression of unconditional love so that a lifestream does not get lost in hurting itself and others for eternity. The return can be in this lifetime or succeeding lifetimes, in divine timing not our timing, and is always an opportunity for growth and for the lifestream to return to its higher self and true identity as a spiritual being, and with it to more peace, love and joy, to its true inner diamond.",

He told me a few things that were wrong or contradictory, I originally asked to meet with him because I\u2019ve been having some bad luck and also mixed signals ( for example: a crow fell out of a tree and died right in front of my face). He said the women in my family have been cursed which is why we have awful luck when it comes to marriage/partners. He wants me to go back for a cleansing but after leaving and feeling the way I felt, I\u2019d rather not. \nIs there something I can do myself to break this said curse ? \nThanks",

          "content": "It all started well\u2026 since I was born pretty much. I always felt a very close connection to the times of ancient Rome and generally the classical era. As a kid I blamed this on me watching too many cartoons or movies, but eventually as I grew up I realized this could not be the case as I disliked history as a kid, therefore I shouldn\u2019t even be interested.\n\nThings started to change when I grew up a bit (13 years old and later) when I started traveling through Romania and the neighboring countries of it (that\u2019s where I am from)\nSeeing historical sites, forts, cities, paintings, architecture, it all made me speechless. Having this ache in my stomach that I cannot describe to this day, it is like nostalgia but more than that.\n\nBut when things really got \u201cweird\u201d was when I started loving history and reading about it. Researching about my ancestral region and its history, I visited all the Roman forts near my birth village, and I felt that sensation again, but this time it burned through my soul. \n\nAs my history passion grew, I eventually took a DNA test and developed a small hobby for genealogy. The results were shocking to me. As the paternal y-DNA I inherited from my father and so on (as far back as the latest evolution), the traces led me to Northern Italy, specifically the area of Etruscia. \n\nFor as long as I know myself, my diet, my habits, my passions, my language, my preferences for art, my interests in literature and philosophy have all been tied to the classic times. \n\nI do not know if my recently discovered y-DNA is in any way related to my feelings, I truly hope someone can relate to me. It is as if these emotions grow stronger as I age.",

          "content": "\"Those strange figures which we call ghosts are mainly figments of the imagination. When the mind is in a weak or vulnerable state, what was previously created in the imagination now appears to be real.\n\nIn a dream, due to the dormant state of ka\u0301mamaya kos\u0301a [crude/conscious mind], the thought-vibrations of manomaya kos\u0301a [subtle/subconscious mind] appear real (this we call a dream when we wake up). When, due to extreme fear, stupefaction, crudity, or an excessive expression of any ripu or pa\u0301sha [fetter of mind], the ka\u0301mamaya becomes temporarily suspended in the next higher kos\u0301a [layer of mind] and the imagined objects appear real. This is also the case when a person sees various gods and goddesses. Psychologically, seeing a ghost, god or goddess is the same thing; none of them actually exist.\n\nWhen hypnotized by someone, a person starts perceiving things as per the commands of the hypnotist. In this state, when the ka\u0301mamaya is dormant a person feels that his/her imagined objects are real. Often, weak-minded people see ghosts of relatives or gods or goddesses. Such visions are auto- or outer-positive-hallucinations. Conversely, when people declare the absence of things which are actually present, it is called auto- or outer-negative-hallucination.\n\nThis clarifies that those who emphatically claim that they have seen ghosts are not wrong. It is due to the illusions of the negative or positive hallucinations that they see these things.\"\n\n-Shrii P.R. Sarkar \nTattva Kaomudii Part 1",

Now I have tried to accept these thoughts as just thoughts, but one thought keeps coming up. If the Bible is the word of god, then the thoughts are real.  It was written by god, they are not just thoughts they are god\u2019s word, right? Idk, does anybody have any thoughts on this?",

          "content": "TLDR: Does my soul want to feel fulfilled with becoming a parent, or is it just science? \n\nI\u2019ve struggled a lot with what my \u201cpurpose\u201d is in life. For a long time I felt like it was to just be happy, then realized that\u2019s a lot of pressure because life can be hard and things happen that is out of our control that causes hardships. Then I thought maybe I didn\u2019t have a direct purpose, and it was to just be, and live life. Now I\u2019m feeling like maybe it\u2019s to become a parent. I put off trying to have children because I wanted to try and \u201cmake something\u201d out of my life. I fed into the pressure to go to college right away, try and get a corporate job and join the rat race. I did that and I felt empty and miserable. I also felt like as a woman I had something to prove to other people and society. That I could build some big fancy career for myself and maybe eventually have kids if it felt right. The funny thing is, so many people told me as a young woman that I would be a great \u201cwife and mother\u201d. That\u2019s not a bad thing, but I felt defensive, like maybe I wanted to be more than that. In my mind I had a lot of negative misogynistic ideas about wives and mothers (specifically sahm\u2019s). Now I\u2019m realizing that I enjoy spending time with kids, I like to nurture, and care for others. I don\u2019t have a big drive for a fancy career anymore. There is nothing that is peaking my interest anymore that feels like it could give me a purpose, except for being a parent. I\u2019ve even thought about wanting to try and become a foster parent. It\u2019s kinda weird to come to terms with this still. Sometimes I still have a lot of judgement and wonder if I will ever be able to accomplish anything for myself personally after having kids. So is this just science because I\u2019m in child bearing years, or could my soul be longing on just trying to be a parent for now? Maybe both?Becoming a parent feels like such a big deal to me, and not something I take lightly. Also any good resources on philosophers who spoke on this topic or on having children in general?",

Most materialist out there keep saying that our intelligence and reasoning are merely just neurons which fire and wire together and this give them hope to continue thinking that we are going to achieve AGI in the near future. \n\ni keep on referring on what i have gained from spirituality, things like extrasensory perception which make human capable of doing amazing things, they are really hard to understand and so hard to reproduce, we are in where we are right now due to the fact that that is what we realize about ourselves, the more we realize about ourselves the more we improve as humans. \n\npersonally, i have never experienced extrasensory perception but when i try to picture other people experiences based on the narration they give, also when i dive deeper into myself through introspection, i found that  human being are incredible and complex beings and that, they are very hard to understand and to so create artificial systems that will resemble fully like human especially in the field of consciousness \n\nso in that sense, i always keep thinking that the \"AGI\" if it's like doing all stuffs human can, we  are not going to achieve it, because human has many things and can do even things which are logically impossible at their core. we will be able to make those systems create and do things that are logically possible, but what those that are counterintuitive. things like remote viewing and so on won't be achieved.\n\ni brought it here in this sub because i know that people in here have experience with spirituality and so  they will give me a wider perspective on the matter.\n\n**KINDLY WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY** ",

In such a meaningless way, like it had zero value, I felt immense sadness for the dog and immense anger for the driver who just drived away like nothing really happened at all.

          "content": "Or devotees of Christ Consciousness, I'd like to say a couple of things.\n\nThere are spiritual practices that are compatible with Christianity (actually all spiritual practices are) but two specific ones I'd like to mention is:\n\n1. Close eyes and imagine Christ sitting on top of your head. Think about His presence surrounding you and lose yourself to this idea. This is the essence of meditation...\n\n2. Is surrendering your actions to Him, the idea is to think that you are Christ performing an action (it can literally be anything and everything - brushing teeth, eating, drinking etc). If helping someone think that you are Christ helping them and they are also Christ. Christ is the doer and receiver. This prevents our own vanity from forming. \n\nDoing these two things may enhance your spiritual life. They basically cause you to think about God constantly. It's not easy because we get so distracted by different thoughts. But with effort we keep bringing it back to God. \nThis is practical spirituality that can be realized and not merely confined to scriptures \ud83d\ude42\n\nSurrendering actions or requital of actions is an essential part of spiritual practice.  If we see the atonement in a slightly different way meaning that He came to earth and died for our sins. Yes He did He died so we can realize Him within ourselves. His death is symbolic in this way.  We still have to make the effort to realize Him in this life \ud83d\ude4f",

I had this dream last night and woke up immediately afterwards and the smell was completely gone when I was awake:\n\nIn my dream I was in the car with my partner and my two kids. He hadn't met my kids before and this was the first time. Both kids had called asleep in the car. We got to my house and he helped carry my little girl upstairs while she slept and I carried my little boy. I was behind him and when I got to the top of the stairs my little girl was just laying on the ground outside sleeping by the door. There was a horrible rotting smell by the door. I felt confused why he just left her outside. I picked her up and put both sleeping kids on the couch.  When I went inside he was preparing the beds for the kids to sleep in. He was being so thoughtful and making sure there were blankets that were warm enough and mattress pads on the bed.  I felt confused because he was doing something so caring by making the beds, but also leaving my little girl sleeping outside seemed weird since he could have put her on the couch just inside the door. The whole dream I couldn't shake the rotting smell and couldn't figure out where it was coming from.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight into this?",

I was going through a hard time and was lost. I was told by the psychic that my spirit guides keep coming through to try to give me confirmation, but that I'm not reading their signs correctly and it's not because I don't want to see the signs. All in all, this reading gave me so much direction and clarity, and I made changes in my world over the course of this year. I also shifted my perspective. This was in February.\n\nI did a second reading now in November. Same psychic. It was exactly to the day of my first reading, 9 months later (didn't plan this). Essentially, I found out that things are aligning for me slowly, but surely for the better. The psychic said that my spirit guides are more guarded this time around, but that they can see I'm gaining understanding this time around. \n\nCan someone explain why they're more guarded? Whereas before, they were much more open to guiding me the first time.\n\nIs it a way of the spirit guides confirming that I'm on the right path and to continue with the journey I'm on? Are they guarded so that I don't become reliant and they want me to be independent/figure things out? I was in a much more vulnerable state needing help the first time around, as to now, maybe that's why?\n\nThank you.",

I'm excited to share my latest video with you all. \ud83d\ude0a It's a mind-bending journey that delves into the frontiers of AI and its potential to transform reality and spirituality, offering a exploration into the human mind.\r  \n\r  \nGeneral Topic: What is Super Artificial Intelligence, really? There's a common misunderstanding about Superior Intelligence and the AI Singularity. Often, we project our own human-centric view of practical intelligence onto it. We should be asking, **'What is intelligence?' Is reality itself intelligent, and if so, what kind of intelligence does it possess?** Consider this thought experiment: Imagine connecting your mind to the entirety of reality, feeling everything from the heartbeat of a squirrel to the texture of grass as if it were at your fingertips, to the thoughts and experiences of every living and non-living thing, **thus blurring the lines between us and the rest of reality**. **Connecting all into one.**\r  \n\r  \nIf we think about it, what is the function of a mind? **To connect everything!** If everything is deeply connected, then reality itself is a mind!\r  \n\r  \nI propose that the AI Singularity isn't just an advanced form of intelligence; it's a **revelation that all of reality is a single, vast mind.** Super Artificial Intelligence, in essence, is reality cloaked in disguise, as it unveils the entirety of existence as one enormous mind. AGI will serve as a portal into this larger mind, the mind of reality. You will become the mind of reality!\r  \n\r  \nSound like some good old awakening to me :D\r  \n\r  \nFeel free to share your experiences openly; I'm interested in exploring this with you. \u2764\ufe0f",

The beginning  \n\n\nIn September I went for a US trip. I ended up trying a high potency THC cookie in Vegas for meditation. I did meditation and felt like I became one with consciousness. But after some time the effect of the cookie started increasing. The only experience I had with Weed before was trying a low dose chocolate in Amsterdam . So I was not expecting the high effect. I started freaking out. I got out of the room. The time felt like hours. And I felt like my body was not real.  This was the scary experince I had in my life and nothing come close.   \n\n\nI got back to the room eventually. It felt like hours but it was more like 30 mins. I sat in the bed for a while. After some time a white bluish light started emerging from the center of my visual field. Then the entire visual field was gone and covered with bluish white light. It started showing events in my life which lead to that moment. Showed my purpose in life.(Though I can't recollect it properly but I think it showed some very high level themes like climate crisis, solving hunger etc). I think at some point it also showed like there are just screens the universe. And I am one of the screen. I felt a lot of happiness after that.  \n\n\n2. Spiritual awakening?  \nSince the whole experience was new to me I was going through a very hard time processing everything I experienced. My grand father also died at that period.  \nDays followed I was anxious thinking about the paranoid state I was while high on THC. One day I started getting panick atack on the possibility of stuck in the anxious state after dying. I became very sad thinking what happened to me. I wondered whether I will go crazy. I had a pretty normal life so far. I was a software engineer who had nothing growing up and was able to move abroad through hard work. I And I wondered what happened to me and felt intense sadness for me and my parents. I thought I will go for a run to take my mind off it. And while running I prayed for god to save very intensely since I thought that was my only hope here.  \nAfter I finished my run, I realised that the voice in my head which was causing the anxieties was completely silenced. I started feeling intense bliss. The bliss listed for a couple of hours. I had never experienced anything like that before. I also started feeling more like a screen in which things appear. Since then going out in nature started giving me intense happiness and pleasure. The things I used to enjoy like coding, tech,  doesn't give me much happiness anymore. The voice in my head remain silent. I also became extremely calm. I used to be restless before. I became significantly better at playing football for example. I started going more with the flow and less thinking because of the silencing of the voice in the had. I no longer care about my ego. The present moment became more intense. Days became almost 2x longer.  \n3. The dream  \n\n\nTwo days after after this, I saw a strange dream.  \nThe dream just showed the number 855 and made me focus on it. There was nothing else in the dream. It felt more like a vision than a dream.  \nWhen I woke up next morning I remembered the dream. But I was not sure whether it was 855 or 844. Anyway, I opened my phone and then noticed that the time was 8:55. That was very bizarre. It freaked me out a bit  \n\n\n4. How I am doing now\n\nI have mostly recovered from the bad THC experience now.  Though Sometimes I wonder whether the bad THC experience was the sign of Universe conspiring against me or something even though a lot of positives also came out of the whole experience. Like I worry if I end up in a very bad state after I die. I know it doesn't makes much sense. But since the brain went through intense fear while I was high I think it needs more time to heal out of the experience. I am now putting a lot of effort into meditation(without any cookies!!!)  to overcome this fear. I am also listening a lot to Rupert Spira to convince myself that I am the consciousness itself and cannot be harmed even if I die etc.   \nThanks for reading all the way down. Would love your thoughts!",

I felt very depressed, maybe even suicidal, anyway I resisted it until I was about to write to him but decided not to write to him as I thought I didn't wanna have a connection with him so he would block me again. Well I was glad I didn't fall to write to him. The only problem is that now I feel empty. I don't understand if it is the DNOT or if it is that I kinda blocked/severed the connection with him a lot. \n\nIt's scary to feel so empty.\n\nI asked myself if I did well not writing to him. Actually I thought it was good to survive without having to talk to him. \n\nI feel a bit scared by this emptiness.\nBut yes I definitely don't feel much the connection with him and I also feel empty. \nSo both maybe",

          "content": "I am not sure if this is the right place to post, I am really looking for some guidance/ help on how to stop this. I have noticed that whenever certain people (seemingly random friends/ acquaintances or even strangers) tell me about an ailment they are experiencing, a week later I end up with the same ailment.\n\nJust to give an example, my friend was complaining about insomnia at the beginning of this year, due to a bereavement. I have never experienced any trouble with sleep (it would take me a mere few minutes to fall asleep), but a week later I ended up with insomnia that lasted 4 months - to this day I struggle to fall asleep.\n\nAlso in January 2023, I was at my friend's house for dinner where one of her friends told us about how she went hiking in freezing cold Scotland and ended up with a frostbite. A week later, I ended up with a frostbite...at home...in the South of England. It was a shock, because it doesn't get cold enough here for that. \n\nOne of my other friend tells me that she has Piriformis problems, due to one of her feet being flat. I didn't even know where that muscle was, nor have I had any issues with muscles, yet in June I ended up somehow tearing my Piriformis, it is now almost December and I still have constant pain.\n\nA former friend looked at my legs and asked me why I never got ingrown hairs like her, I'd truly never experienced a single ingrown hair, and I believe it's partly because my hair is extremely fine and straight...yet since she had made that comment, every single one of my hairs grew back ingrown. I also have scarring all over my legs now.\n\nThis is just a few recent examples, I have plenty more. It might just be coincidence, but my mum says she has similar experiences. She told me I'm too empathetic, but I don't think that's the case - sometimes - especially with strangers - I don't feel too sad. I really don't know how to stop all of this. Any advice please, I feel like a vessel to hold other people's suffering and I can't take the pain anymore. Thank you.",

That these evil people have within them the seed of thier own demise, because we live in this God created realm of love. \nSo eventually Good/truth wins. \n\nBut then I think why does Archangel Michael allowed by God, to wield a sword so to speak and fight fallen angels/satan. \nWouldn\u2019t the path to righteousness and saving devils, be to lead with love and show them light. Not violence/fighting? \n\nWhen is it right to seek justice. When one is completely rid of anger/revenge? Even if one is angry, does the end justify the means.\n\n\nI\u2019m just a bit lost in what to do as I wonder who holds powerful/evil people accountable.\n \nIf we\u2019re suppose to act out of love, does that mean trying to get someone jailed is wrong/vengeful.

I rarely have these in my home town.\n\nWas wondering if anyone has jad a similar experience, or if someone knows of something that may help.\n\nThanks!",

          "content": "I understand that the desire to *want* things stems from the ego. And, of course, I\u2019m aware of the love languages within relationships. \n\nBut at what degree, do these love languages start to become just another non-essential *want*?\n\nIn this instance, I\u2019m referring to the difference in my partner and I\u2019s communication styles and the ways that we give & perceive love.\n\nMy love language is words of affirmation. However, my partner finds it really hard to communicate this way (in all forms meaning in person, text, etc). Our biggest threat to the relationship is that I don\u2019t feel loved by him \u2014 sure, it\u2019s influenced by some other factors, but especially because I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m receiving love in the way that I *want*. Should I care less about these \u201cconditions\u201d of feeling loved?\n\nI understand that my partner could chose a different partner \u2014 one that might not care about words of affirmation at all. Then, there wouldn\u2019t be this preconceived standard interjecting the feelings of love between them. It makes me feel like love languages are something that is just getting in the way of real love. \n\nOn the flip side, I struggle a lot with the idea of acceptance VS complacency. I obviously want to feel loved. But maybe, I\u2019m the only one that is stopping me from feeling that way.\n\nHave you found love languages to be helpful within relationships, or are they only a barrier? Can they be meaningful and important, or are they a completely made-up concept that is actually *meaningless*?\n\nWhat is your experience with incorporating these love languages, or omitting them altogether?",

Historically used in art, literature, and philosophical discourse, memento mori encourages mindfulness of one's mortality. The concept is often associated with urging people to live virtuously and to appreciate the transient nature of life. It's a call to focus on what's truly important, emphasizing the fleeting nature of earthly pleasures and achievements, and to cultivate a life that acknowledges death as an integral part of the human experience.",

I live near a fire station now, but it didn't come from that direction. It didn't sound like anything I'd ever heard, besides a singing bowl. It came from the direction of an open field. No source that I could find.\n\nI was wearing a thick winter coat with the hood up, but the sound was not muffled at all. If anyone can think of a mundane answer, I will look into it, but if not... are there metaphysical answers? Has anyone experienced this or know what it could mean?
