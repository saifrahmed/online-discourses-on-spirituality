But does anyone else deal with trying to find a balance with your ego your mind and your higher self. My boyfriend has a friend who says some offensive things. And I normally don't say anything and I try to keep the peace.  I know that it's not on his journey yet to realize what he's saying is not right. But then again I also think that I should say something because what he's saying isn't right. And this happens with a lot of other scenarios as well. \nAny advice yall got would be amazing!",
