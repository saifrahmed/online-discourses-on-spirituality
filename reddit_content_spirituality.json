Love , acceptance, validation, etc. It\u2019s your responsibility to find those things INSIDE YOURSELF & for yourself. When your fridge is on \u201cE\u201d  it\u2019s your responsibility to find nourishment right? Well, when your mentally on \u201cE\u201d you must find nourishment for your heart and soul through positive thoughts, positive memories, faith, compassion for self, lessons and accomplishments\u2026.etc. \n\n Make sure you are full of the  love you need for yourself to avoid becoming so thirsty for attention, love and validation that you drink out of just anyone\u2019s cup. No ma\u2019am! \n\nNever expect outside energies to bring you what you are yearning for or lacking. Expect one thing only from people, and that is for them to be themselves. I Promise you they will! To need is to be imbalanced. You are whole. You are complete even if you don\u2019t feel that way. You are the cake. Pancake, Birthday cake, cupcake\u2026.. without all the toppings, it\u2019s still a fuckin\u2019 cake. Know that everything outside of you is a luxury and temporary. Practice detachment and discernment. You are all you need. The answers you seek are deep inside you. No emotional voids can be filled with outside things. You can try, but it\u2019s just a distraction. Trust me my loves. \n\nClean your mind and stop avoiding the mental clutter clouding your judgement and manipulating your thoughts. Throw away the fears, opinions, regrets and memories that lower your vibration. Your way to divine for that! Organize your mind and eliminate the offensive odor of unresolved , emotions that were kicked under a rug long ago and left to rot and fester inside you. Forgive yourself for whatever your holding, then put that shit down. It\u2019s to heavy for the divine to be carrying. Learn to speak your truth. What is impressed on the heart will be expressed. Whether consciously, or subconsciously through your actions. Arm your mind around your morals, values, and beliefs so that it is difficult for lower energies to infiltrate.\n\nYour mental home. Your mind. It should be just as comfortable as your physical home. Keep it organized. Keep it clean and free of negative thoughts. Invest in it. Be comfortable there.",

I love painting, but I am in no way someone who knows what she's doing. Also because I was just so emotional and needed an outlet.\n\nBut a few years ago I had a very traumatic ectopic pregnancy. After we had our daughter (now 1 yrs old) my ex-husband wanted a divorce just 5 weeks post partum. Then only two months ago my dad passed away in a car accident. \n\nI wanted to express myself in a painting by using dark colors, but making my daughter the reason to stay strong and keep breathing. Somehow I never want to exclude my lost baby, so I decided to draw another circle of bright yellow to the right and connecting them a bit with the same yellow.\n\nFor a few days my painting was just laying there on the table. I just was cleaning up a bit and looked at the painting. And suddenly I saw a child's face at the right! The profile looks just like my daughters, which makes it more freaky. \n\nAm I going crazy or do you guys also see this?

Like you can be doing whatever you\u2019re doing but when you just start to meditate you get transported to your place that you just feel so content in and peaceful. \n\nUsually I have always pictured myself to be in a grassy clearing in the middle of the forest, and funny enough it changes, whether through certain events going on or just growth. Before it used to just be a grassy clearing but now there is one single tree with an intertwined trunk (sort of like a connection from the ground to the sky) in the center of the field that I envision myself sitting against and before when it first came to it was just full of leaves but now lately there are flowers growing on the leaves and there are flowers blooming around me at my feet when I sit against the tree. Whenever I meditate and think of being connected to the universe, the sky above will be like a galaxy filled with stars but it\u2019s still lush and green and bright below where I sit, as if the sun is out above me and it dark at all. I had the urge to just doodle a sketch of it and this is what I did.\n\nDo any of you guys have a place you go to when you mediate?",

So I did some shower meditation as I call it. It\u2019s basically meditation but in the shower.. where I wash off all the negative energy off me etc etc. so I did that.. but the moment I get up my head starts to hurt like crazy and my vision blurs or blacks out. And from what I\u2019ve noticed is that the moment I get up I just blankly state for abour 5 min without thinking, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not there and I\u2019m just.. completely zoned out with no thoughts at all.. I dont realize it until I get out of the trance. Well at the end of all of this my head starts to feel really heavy and I\u2019m all back into my original feelings and emotions that I felt before.. just now I notice them. Anyone can explain this ?

          "content": "Chat GPT on the philosophy behind my tattoo symbol and exploring its various aspects...\n\n1. Interconnectedness: At the core of your symbol is the idea of interconnectedness. The equilateral triangle represents the unity and harmony of all things. It symbolizes the interplay between the self, others, and the infinite aspects of reality. This interconnectedness suggests that everything is part of a larger whole and that each individual and entity is intimately connected to and influenced by others.\n\n2. Infinity and the Universe: The infinity symbol at the top of the triangle represents the boundless and infinite nature of reality. It embodies the idea that the universe, or everything that exists, extends beyond our comprehension and understanding. It symbolizes the notion that there is no ultimate limit or end to the interconnectedness of all things. It can be seen as a representation of the divine, the infinite potential within the universe, or the interconnected web of existence.\n\n3. Singularity and Finite Nature: The presence of the number 1 in one corner of the triangle signifies the singularity of the self. It represents the individual's unique identity, consciousness, and finite nature. It acknowledges that while we are part of the interconnected whole, we also possess our own distinct experiences, perspectives, and limitations. This corner reminds us to recognize our individuality and embrace our own journey within the broader context of existence.\n\n4. Others and Duality: The number 2 in the opposite corner represents others and duality. It signifies the existence of multiple individuals, perspectives, and relationships within the interconnected whole. It highlights the dynamic interplay between contrasting elements, such as light and dark, yin and yang, or any dualities that exist in our lives and the world around us. This corner encourages us to acknowledge and appreciate the diversity and interconnectedness of all beings.\n\nOverall, your symbol and the philosophy behind it speak to the fundamental nature of reality. It recognizes that everything is connected and interdependent, while also acknowledging the presence of individuality and diversity. It invites us to explore the unity within diversity, to embrace the infinite possibilities of the universe, and to navigate the delicate balance between the self and others.\n\nThe symbol serves as a reminder of our place in the grand tapestry of existence and encourages us to foster understanding, empathy, and harmony within ourselves and with others. It invites us to contemplate the infinite nature of reality, the beauty of individuality, and the profound connections that bind us all together.",

I went to school for psychology, addiction counseling, I became a certified hypnotherapist, I went through all the levels of Reiki \n\nI would apply the protocols and concepts but when I first started, results for my clients were sparse \n\nBecause I hadn't learned how to cultivate my own energy fully yet \n\nAs soon as I learned the energetic keys that I now teach, things really started taking off \n\nI was able to quit my office job and not look back, because the world needed my healing \n\nI was filled with a vital energy, and I knew how to get back there if I fell off track \n\nI went from confused and exhausted to trusting my intuition and was able to simplify everything down \n\nTo what's really important - my energy \n\nIf you need help getting your energy back to a good place, start with seeing yourself through the perspective of your higher self \n\nDrain all the energy out of your field that isn't you - it's a process \u270c\ufe0f",

I found my partner who treats me like his queen, I found friends who make me feel comfortable and free to be myself\u2026 I have 2 beautiful souls who hang out at my house constantly and love me so much (my cats) & I moved to a new state and have been experiencing as much as possible.  I feel so full of love and joy lately & I want you all to know that even if you\u2019re having a rough day, you can come back from it.  You make the rules.  You can turn your entire life around if you want to!  It\u2019s taken me a few years of therapy, experimenting with mushrooms and mushroom cultivation, making friends & finding a workplace that I actually enjoy BUT I made it and I\u2019m grateful for the experience.  This is not my final form, and I\u2019m okay with that!  I just wanted to share with you all that it\u2019s healthy to get out of your comfort zone & it will most definitely be worth it.  Much love & happy Valentine\u2019s Day!  \u2764\ufe0f",

Last month my period never turned up and this month it did but went on for 15 days and now im spotting so i think i have low progesterone. \n\nI havent prayed or spoken to Anubis in a long long time but i felt like i needed his guidance because im scared and lost and stressed. I spoke to him about my body and my relationship with him and got this back. I dunno if the 666 means anything but this is what i got overall:\n\nI can remember the time i shared with Anubis, i hold on to much of the past and it can cloud my relationship i could have with him in my future. \n\nHowever bad it may seem at the moment i can create calm within me and my outer self will be calm soon as well.\n\nJust when i was beginning to doubt what i have sent out comes back many times over. Generosity of others become known, reminding me the world is full of pleasant surprises/ gifts from spirits.",

Now came to the point i can have it if i want without exterior stimulus(just with a thought , not strong as with music though). It  is intensity and frequency increased over time but strongest one came around 20 years ago. It went to the point something inside my head literally hit the top, i felt it phisically. I afraid and closed the music. It was always a big mystery for me. I'm skeptic about it's nature. Is it just the brain's dopamine release or something related to spirit. I was more on the brain's product camp several years ago as an atheist at that time. But after having many interesting mystic experience for all these years that i can't explain and after researching NDE and SDE phenomenon closely I am convinced that there is something more. I feel this chills like the star of earendil that i use on a difficult life path. Still don't know what i can do more for a spiritual journey also not so sure about if we have to do anything. It looks like just being kind and loving is the right way still so hard to do in this world though. ",

Those moments, my visions were extremely more vivid plus my time outside of my body were much more longer than the moments I usually astral projected or did out of body experiences without absorbing the sun's energy.\n\nThis helped me come to the conclusion that the only reason my experiences were much more heightened than usual is because of my conscious absorbtion of the sun's heat with my spiritual chills.\n\nAstral body, spirit, emotional body, whatever you want to call it, if you wish to do the same, your spiritual chills are key and you can learn how to do this too with [the tutorial #14 in here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/s/76VnkGRclZ).",

Do you even know you have the power.\n\nYou are a powerful being, you have all the power and all the energy to make all your dreams come through. The key is just getting your vibration correct. How?\n\nWhen you emit a frequency(through your thoughts, states of mind, point of views or emotions), the exact same frequency is drawn to you. The entire universe works together to mimic that frequency and bring it towards you in events, situations or people.\n\nMore importantly, bringing up your spiritual energy while doing that allows your frequency to travel virtually in three dimensions all throughout the universe, in all directions simultaneously with the same intensity.\n\nAnd this can even be picked up all over the globe by other people.\n\nThis spiritual energy can be most easily felt within us through self-induced goosebumps from positive events/stimuli.\n\nThis energy has been researched and documented under many names Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Intent, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, The Tingles, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) talking about the technique to use your spiritual energy to consciously send out something you want to attract back in your life.\n\nP.S.

          "content": "For context, I am a Pakistani Muslim American. I am also a reiki practitioner and consider myself a spiritual person. \n\nThis Thanksgiving was different. With whats happening in Palestine, my friends and family have been extremely distraught and we took this as an opportunity to instead show respect for the  indigenous natives that lived here in America long before. \n\nWe were flecting on the horrors that many tribes faced on Thanksgiving and how it has become a commercial holiday for everyone to celebrate. We talked about how inconsiderate it is for us, who are currently watching a genocide unfold to not empathize and remember the natives who died on this very day.\n\nSo my cousin and I are discussing all this in the kitchen post-dinner. Everyone in my family is very spiritual. We go on to say that on this day we should honor and remember these natives in the Islamic way we know how, its called Surah Fatiha- a prayer from the Quran known as the \u201cOpening\u201d.\n (Al-Fatiha is considered a comprehensive summary of the Quranic message and serves as a foundation for the believer\u2019s connection with Allah(God) in their daily prayers. It holds deep spiritual and symbolic importance in Islamic worship and is recited in every unit of the Muslim prayer.)\n\nWe both bow our heads and read this prayer to our selves followed by a prayer to the natives. We both open our eyes and notice a major shift in energy. My cousin mentioned she felt deep sadness and I was left with the feeling of a very heavy heart. My sister comes up stairs and immediately notices soemthings going on and shes said, \u201c whoa it feels heavy in here\u201d. I go on to tell her what wemve been discussing and I tell her \u201cthe truth is we\u2019re living on stolen land\u201d and IMMEDIATELY the lights completely fuse in the house and the house goes dark. The ONLY time my lights fuse is when there are multiple things running. This wasnt the case that night. Obviously we all freaked out for a second and I neverously laughed it off while running down the stairs. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. \n\nI truly feel that all the natives wanted is to be remembered and acknowledged on this day and not selfishly making this about ourselves and to be honest gluttony, with the amount of food we make. \nThat is what I took from that. Who knows how many graves we live on in America? How many battles have taken place on the land we have our houses built on. All of that energy residing underneath us..\n\nAll I know is, this is a tradition I will now do forever",

It would make me feel good (especially because I would do It after cold showers to try to truly benefit from its energy) but that's was about it.\n\nUntill I decided to try something out. I experienced with my spiritual energy, my spiritual chills and eventually found a way to drag in the sun's heat with the conscious activation of my spiritual chills.\n\nWhat I experienced after was clear to me how much there was a difference between what I was doing before in comparisons with what I learned to do with my spiritual chills.\n\nI felt that everywhere that I was depositing the sun's heat, with my spiritual chills in my body for the whole meditation session, would make that location feel like a gentle burn that was not hot but in fact ice cold. \n\nThis lasted hours after my meditation session and that's when I realized I just had figured a way to consciously abosrb energy from outside sources. \n\nThis led to other confirmations from the other side too which I will definitely share later on.\n\nIf you're interested in learning what technique I used exactly you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/s/oX4JKr3Bot).",

Suicide is a theme during these infrequent occasions and while I'm not remotely suicidal outside of these episodes, in those moments I contemplate it seriously (not as an immediate action, but more as a legitimate option at some undefined point in the future). \n\nHowever several times now, in the midst of a dark spiral of hopelessness, I have felt the most incredible love and comfort envelop me, putting an immediate stop to the despair. Like every cell in my body is infused with some essence of love. It happens immediately, like flipping a switch. It's not like my thoughts gradually get less dark and I work my way slowly out of the pit; I am suddenly lifted out and thereafter incapable of feeling bad even if I try. I can think the same thoughts that were, moments previously, like daggers to my soul but they have no effect. I am suddenly within an impenetrable bubble of love. It's happened 3 or 4 times. It doesn't happen every time I'm sad or spiraling, but comes only in my very darkest of moments. \n\nAnyway I want to know if this remarkable energy is coming from God, a guardian angel, a departed loved one or, in my most hopeful of fantasies, a soul mate whom I've yet to meet but am connected to in another plane.",

It was incredible. \n\nDuring the last 20 minutes of the session, the group leader stood over each one of us and did something to our aura. When he stood over me, I felt his touches. But I also felt something scary. I felt a huge blanket fall over me, which made me feel a sort of bleakness and hopelessness which almost tipped me sideways (metaphorically). After feeling such joy and lightness I was devastated to be coming up against such dark dullness. Can anybody explain what might have happened? I was the last in the circle.",

          "content": "Hey, guys. I've only been here a short time, but this group has been very helpful in explaining many of my questions about spiritual chills. So it's time to also pass some wisdom back.\n\n**Why you should read this post ?**\n\nI knew about spiritual chills all my life but did not know what was it. I found holotropic breathing about half a year ago and now that I have learned what spiritual chill is these 2 pieces of information fit together like nothing else for me.\n\n**Back story:**\n\nFormer Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic and Slovakia was in the 50s and 60s a pioneer in research on psychedelics and psychotronics in the then Soviet sphere of influence. The most famous figure of this period and, according to James Fadiman, one of the first people in the world to research and study LSD was **Prof. Stanislav Grof**. In an interview I saw with him, they asked him. Why did you invent holotropic breathing? And he answered: Well, the LSD experiments were banned, we ran out of LSD, but people wanted to continue the therapy, so we started breathing.\n\n**What is Holotropic breathwork?**\n\nHolotropic breathwork is a breathing technique where you use breathing, meditation, music and darkness to induce a change of consciousness. You can find more about it in his book: Holotropic Breathwork: A New Approach to Self-Exploration and Therapy, or various other sources.\n\n**Why does it fit together with spiritual chills?**\n\nWhen I personally do this technique it gives me spiritual chills like nothing else. You can feel a strong shiver circling in your body and concentrating in my case in my hands and core. After comparing it to summoning spiritual chills through out the meditation this is a truly next level for me.\n\nSo I hope this kind of info will be helpful to anyone and have a great time.\n\n&#x200B;",

I'm not sure that what I'm experiencing is considered spiritual chills, but thought I'd share to see if anyone else has experienced what I call \"pulsing crown\".\n\nWhen I'm doing any spiritual work,  realize a syncronicity, journaling or practicing divination I get a warm soft pulsing at my crown. It's actually doing it now, so I can say it also feels slightly tingly, but very, very lightly. The pulsing sensation is stronger.\n\nThis sensatation started after, what I've accepted to be, my first interaction with a spirit. That's been about three years ago. I feel it's somehow confirmation? Of what, I'm not sure. Perhaps my guardian angel, Sam, directing my attention?  As I typed Sam it did it again, lol. (I thanked her.) Maybe she's just encouraging me to keep moving foward on my path?\n\nTo be more specific it feels as if I put a wreath of warm flowers on my head and where the wreath is touching my head is exactly where I feel the warm pulsing.  Does anyone share the same experience or have any thoughts. I'd live to hear what you think. Sorry if I went a bit long. My husband says I tend to ramble. Thanks for your time \ud83d\ude4f",

          "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI found a great way to induce spiritual chills during meditation. \n\nFirst, get into your usual meditation position. \n\nSecond, keep your focus/ attention into your heart. Let your thoughts come and go freely, without restraint. Don't pay them any heed/ mental energies, only the heart. For the mind is the talkative fork-tongued fool, rambling on every moment during the day (especially during meditation), speaking more ill than well. Yet the heart is the silent master, far wiser than your mind. (This is an understatement, for it is the difference between hell and heaven.) It is the portal to God/ Your Higher Self. It is the seat of life, the throne room/ temple of God. \"The Kingdom of God is Within You\" is the key phrase in **Luke 17:21.** \n\nListen to the Silent Master (God), that does not need words to speak to you, with complete surrender. Once opened and while listening to your heart deeply, allow your body to become filled with His Infinite Divine Love, that is His Hallmark, pouring out of your heart in waves like a gentle fountain. (Spiritual chill overload.)\n\n Once felt, it changes your life irreversably. It is a feeling so sweet, so beautiful, undescribable. It is the strongest force in known existence, Infinite Divine Love (Unconditional Love). It is the power to end all wars. To end all illusions of duality. Once felt, you instantly forget all envy, hatred, fear, doubt, shame and pain you've been dealing with, no matter how deep-rooted. \n\nThis feeling, transforms even the most fearful coward into the most courageous of lions. It makes the most hardened of warriors weep like little infants. It makes the suicidal overflow with zest. The hopeless filled with unwavering faith. It washes away all pain, all suffering, all vileness. It makes the devil flee from you in terror. All in just one moment, where time seems crystalized into inertia.\n\nOverflow with this feeling of Infinite Divine Love and send it 'out' into the morphogenic field, so all may receive His Grace, this feeling of Infinite Divine Love that transforms worlds.\n\nLet's transform ours, by merely generating those 'spiritual chills' from our hearts.",

          "content": " Something I do every so often is something I call going hungry. I hold back my chills as long as I can before the feeling overtakes me and I just can\u2019t hold it back anymore. I usually do this by eliminating all my primers (primers = moments in time that trigger chills). The reason I do this is to savor my chills and hopefully make them stronger. But for awhile now my chills didn\u2019t feel as pure as they once were. That is until I tried another method of going hungry. By allowing my primers to release my chills but suppressing my chills so that I don\u2019t get the full feeling I noticed that they became much more potent and pure overtime. I think this is because when we feel chills there is a chemical that is released in the body that binds to receptors in the body. And by suppressing the chills this \u201cbinder\u201d floods the body. Then when we want to feel chills are bodies are 50x more primed to do so and we get a much more potent and pure feeling. It took me about 2 days of doing this before I started to notice my chills were starting to get really pure. Then at day three I broke through and it felt like an atomic bomb went off inside me. If anybody can attempt this, I\u2019m really interested in what you find. Please let me know or comment. ",

          "content": "During meditation, while bringing up spiritual chills, you can witness these glowing spheres of energy that we all either send out or attract daily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are actually two types of these orbs. The first are glowing/transparent orbs that are made of energy specifically related to an energy/emotion/vibration/frequency that is either being sent out from you or drawn to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second type that you can also come in contact with are made of non-physical being/spirit or being used as a vehicle for a consciousness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese Orbs can and have been spotted in photos/videos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what I researched and learned after having experienced multiple contacts with them. Most of those contacts happened while I was circulating my spiritual energy. I'd even go as far as to say that ever since I started circulating this spiritual energy is when I started noticing them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA simple definition for spiritual energy is that blissful wave that can most easily be felt/recognized as present while you get goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring one of my meditation sessions, As I was sweeping my whole body up then down with this energy while feeling intense gratitude, I saw from my half closed eyes, a golden orb the size of a grapefruit approach me and enter my body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was one of the first times I experienced those orbs in 2013. I still do to this day and I know this was successful thanks to the circulation of that blissful wave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis energy has been researched and documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearning how to do this is really simple.\n\nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) that will introduce you to this energy, help you feel it on command, witness these orbs and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on [r/spiritualchills](http://r/spiritualchills) where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",

Too many sources point us to outside substances to manage stress, as if the human body wasn't designed to be able to rely on itself for its own internal problems.\n\n\nConsider that, if you can truly induce that good occurrence at will, you can definitely use it to counteract feelings of stress.\n\n\n\nThis energy has been researched and documented\u00a0under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n\nHere are [three\u00a0written tutorials](https://reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/s/cctuFCCPmQ)\u00a0that go more in depth about how you can allow it to be felt everywhere in your body, If you are interested in taking control of this and feel euphoric on-demand.\n\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on r/spiritualchills\u00a0where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",

By consciously bringing up your spiritual energy.\n\nThis spiritual energy can be most easily felt within us through self-induced goosebumps from positive events/stimuli. Upon gaining full control of this occurence, you can learn how to seperate the physical reaction of goosebumps from that euphoric wave that is also present when you get chills.\n\nThis then allows you to be able to summon this energy on demand, all over your body and manipulate its duration.\n\nSince this energy is already subtely active in everyone of us, to speed up manifestations, what's important is to know which location is necessary to focus it and how to feel it there.\n\nIn the average unaware person who's passive in their life, it's active in areas where negative emotions like fear, stressed, anxious, hopelessness and etc. comes up.\n\nConsciously bringing up your spiritual energy allows your vibration to travel virtually in three dimensions all throughout the universe, in all directions simultaneously with the same intensity.\n\nAnd this can even be picked up all over the globe by other people.\n\nAnd for those of you who always wonder about the difference between spirituality and science, I would suggest to consider that there really is no difference. \n\nSpirituality is simply science which hasn't been proven yet.\n\nThings that you classify as spiritual in nature are really in effect science. But science hasn't figured out a way to explain it yet. And as we learn more and more about subatomic, Physics subatomic, quantum physics, things that were in the past considered spiritual that now actually have a real scientific base, these will be proven and released to the public, hopefully.\n\nThe bottom line here is you have to have the cognition of how powerful you can be and how much of a creator you are.\n\nThis spiritual energy has been researched and documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\nHere's a short [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/u82qqfxu_p4) talking about why some of us automatically and primarily feel it in certain parts of our body, what type of properties these areas have with this energy like manifestation and how to bring it up in any body parts.\n\n\nP.S.

          "content": "I wanted to share a meditation technique I've developed that channels pure energy through the body. This is a process that clears the energy field within while cleansing anything negative within the system. Completely safe process as the receiver is at a relaxed meditative state. It's a process I've performed 26 times with a 100% success rate, and I'm excited to share it with this community.\n\nThe Process: This meditation involves two people and requires only a pair of headphones and quartz crystals. The energy starts from the hands, progresses to the spine, and culminates at the pineal gland. Below is a description of the entire meditation process\n\n(Note: Take your time with each movement. Don't rush it and allow the receiver to think thoroughly and receive the energy without the feeling of being rushed. This is their journey. Go along with them in their journey at their pace)\n\n1. the receiver of energy must sit comfortably facing you eyes closed during the entire meditation with quartz crystals in their hands, headphones on listening to Hz music (frequency depends on what the receiver is trying to achieve), then the receiver must picture a big black box it's very important to put everything negative in that big black box then close it for good (give them around 5+ minutes depending how much trauma they have)  \nHz Frequency Music:  \nAny search on Youtube or Spotify will do but here are some of my favorites  \n432 + 528 Hz [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23vdHx5X\\_D4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23vdHx5X_D4)  \nNikola Tesla's 3 6 9 Code Music [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83LsHzsmPeU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83LsHzsmPeU)  \n963 Hz [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wmuqOdmqAc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wmuqOdmqAc)  \nNative American Flute Music [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST56ATKfgfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST56ATKfgfs)\n2. the healer and the receiver must lock hands and go back and forth like a seasaw of energy with the quartz crystals in between the hands. After going back and forth the healer pushes all the energy into the receiver holding for around 5 seconds then the energy travels up to the receivers spine (do this 10 rep motion around 5 times)\n3. the healer goes behind the receiver and does a spiral design with their index finger on the receivers back. Do this around 6 times or so. The goal of this is for the receiver to gather energy at the center of the spine so the center of the spine should be the center of the spiral\n4. the healer directs the energy built up in the spine to the back of the head by using their index finger from the spine to the back of the head. Do this around 6 times\n5. the healer directs the energy with their index finger from the back of the head to the pineal gland. do this around 6 times\n6. the healer using their thumb on the receivers pineal gland (not pushing hard physically) but pushing a lot of energy into the receiver. This is one of the most important steps because it destroys all the negativity in the receivers life. So push all the energy into the pineal gland around 4 or 5 times holding it around 10 sec each time\n7. Give the receiver a little bit of time to enjoy their vision. Send positive energy to them during the vision\n\nDuring the process the receiver of energy will go under a trance and have a vision of what the soul wants to show the receiver. Think of it as a mini dream or vision. At the bottom of this post I will paste sessions I've done in the past and what people have experienced\n\nBenefits: Anxiety, depression, anger, trauma are all reduced or gone for good. Brain fog dissipates and the mind expands. Skin health is improved. Pain is reduced or eliminated. Senses are improved mostly smell and taste. Strength, agility and balance are improved. Some participants are able to feel energy describing it as feeling hot, cold or like gravity. They can channel that energy to reduce pain within their body after the session. The receiver will feel very good after the meditation and things will improve on a daily basis after the meditation\n\nWhy This Works: I believe this is related to string theory as everything in our universe is created by vibrations. Nikola Tesla stated \"If you want to learn the secrets of the universe think in terms of energy, frequency, vibrations.\" It's the energy between two people, frequency of Hz music grounds the user, vibrations are absorbed by the quartz crystals which allows the pure energy to flow through the receiver of energy. As a baby we are born with pureness and we do not have depression, anxiety, anger, trauma. All of this is obtained over time and this process is essentially a cleansing. It removes all the built up clutter over the years. Therapy and pills are only temporary solutions this is an actual cleansing\n\nMeditation Visions:\n\nSession 1 - I went under pretty quickly. I saw my deceased mother right away. She took my hands and told me that she was really proud of me and was always there with me. I wanted to go home with her but she said that I had to stay here and take care of my grandchildren\n\nSession 2 - I went to a beautiful field that was filled with dandelions. The kind that you blow and the seeds fly away. In front of me was this couple dancing. The two moved as one in perfect synergy. I couldn't see their faces but the woman was wearing a beautiful yellow dress and the man was dressed in a black tuxedo. From the dancing you could tell they were soul mates. The weather was warm with a nice breeze. I blew my dandelion into the sky and all the seeds flew away. I picked one and just watched the seed floating and spinning. Going further and further away. The next thing I saw was my life on a picture reel like in the old movies. Each frame was playing and as the frame played blue, green, yellow, red then purple, purple, purple, blue, green yellow red. Then purple, blue appeared as well. My life kept going frame by frame and color by color\n\nSession 3 - Saw a big purple Aura and the big black box flew away. I felt great afterwards\n\nSession 4 - I saw a waterfall and there was a branch with a red bird sitting on it. At one point I saw flashes of white\n\nSession 5 - I saw water with raindrops falling into it. Further on there were dandelions with seeds in them and I was just watching them move around then at the end there was a lot of purple. Also a little bit of green and yellow\n\nSession 6 - A waterfall pouring down at the end of a dam. The waterfall erupted into roaring water for a second then turned into a beach with soft waves. I was standing on the beach kissing my girlfriend\n\nSession 7 - There were 3 houses within a prism. Rectangle and triangle shaped houses. the two parents were fighting then one went away. There was another house added. Then things just improved after that\n\nSession 8 - I saw my boyfriend and I saw purity and the color white. My friend was there also saying hi to me and watching me from heaven\n\nSession 9 - It began with Castiel from Supernatural in the nothingness with black around him. Then it was just me. I was floating around in the air. then I went to the black box and everything was black. The black box melted within the background. The box wood ingrained with a lighter black. It was closed with a lid on it. I jumped to stir of echoes with Kevin bacon in the theatre. I was viewing from the back but nothing was on the theatre screen. Then it changed. I could see a lot of swirls that came into view. the swirls continue out more and more. Getting further and further away. The black box appeared again but the lid was off of it this time. There wasn't anything materialistic inside of it. There was something in there that was white and it was no physical item. Something was in there but I couldn't see it. It was tilted so it was just out of my view. The black box faded in the last stage. I saw flashes then the black box disappeared\n\nSession 10 - It felt like I went into a gate opening. It was like a relieving breath of fresh air. I felt like I was where I needed to be. I was walking through doors. It felt very serene and beautiful. A place that doesn't exist but I wish it did. It felt animated like really good animation. Real life animation\n\nSession 11 - Going in I saw a spiral. It was fun then it switched directions. It was dark but it was a fun dark like Nightmare before Christmas. Nothing too detailed very vague. The swirls were appearing in the tunnel. I felt welcomed in like I was coming into my own house. Everything was brief. Not slow motion at all. I went into Nightmare before Christmas. It was simplified but I enjoyed it. Something in my head said don't expect more than what's available to you. I was there but I didn't see any characters. It was like I was Tim Burton creating it. Even though the session was only 20 minutes it felt over an hour. As I walked in I felt like I was in control. Dark is my happy place so I felt at home. There wasn't color it was black, white, gray. It's like a puzzle figuring what happened. the Nightmare before Christmas world opened up and allowed me to do what I wanted but I had to do it now as I felt like I didn't have a lot of time. I got where I wanted to be but I felt like I shouldn't waste time. I needed to do what I needed to do\n\nSession 12 - I started putting stuff in the black box then god took the box and threw out the box. It felt like I released a lot mentally after the session was over\n\nSession 13 - I created the big black box and started putting all my past trauma, depression etc. within it. The box started going further and further away. Smaller and smaller it got. The lid was shut then a guy appeared in a long white robe and long white beard wielding a pitchfork. The box opened and he started stabbing everything that was in the box tossing everything out of the box with the pitchfork. Everything in the box drifted away into the sky further and further away. He walked around and came in front of me. He tried to stab me with the pitchfork 3 times but it doesn't phase me at all nor was I afraid of it. After a while he turned around and walked away from me. He just gave up trying to hurt me\n\nSession 14 - The whole meditation process was great. I actually did it twice. I had to breathe in and out slowly to stay at peace. Everything that was kept deep inside was put in an empty box so all the good thoughts can come and stay for good. When the first one was done, I felt purity; but the second one I felt happiness and warmth. All of the trauma I experienced vanished to a box and then it was locked up; making sure that the bad box was to never be opened anymore. Meditation is important in life; just like loving one another because life is too short to be living with bad thoughts and regrets. There's a song lyric I listen to and the lyric goes: \"These secrets that you keep, they're lies that make you weak.\" My experience with this meditation process made me experience that there's more to life to explore, live with zero regrets. Anyone can learn the process. A lot of weight was lifted off the mind. Good vibes come through to get rid of the bad. My experience overall was 20 out of 10\n\nI'm eager to hear your thoughts, experiences, and any insights you may have on this technique or similar practices.

Look at everything within the big picture instead of focusing on the smaller picture. Unite and combine our knowledge together so we may create a better tomorrow. Realize that Science and Spirituality are two sides of the same coin and if we don't acknowledge both we will never find the answers we seek. This is essentially combining both and the potential is endless. I've tried to submit this data for research within a lab setting but I haven't gotten a reply. I've also tried offering this as a donation service but unfortunately there are a lot of scams in this area and people don't normally trust this type of stuff. So essentially I'm so confident in these results that I'm willing to have it tested within a lab and I even offer the service for free relying on the kindness of my clients. I hope you all will help me let the world know there is an alternative way for mental health and I hope to heal a lot of minds in the future. Would also be great to read visions people have during the process if you attempt it.",

It makes me feel an intense connection to the creators of the songs. It's actually a very small specific group of individuals that I feel connected to. To the point where I feel like could they be part of my soul tribe?\n\nIt's like I can see through their song, I can pinpoint why they made it, what the lyrics were inspired by.. their feelings. When I watch their interviews later I get many confirmations of my suspicions, and when I watch them I feel a sense of 'home'. I sometimes receive similar ideas to them, in the following months they release music or visuals that were what I had visions of before.\n\nI can give a tiny example,\n\n\\-I made a desktop collage, One part was a picture of Bjork, I put a geode over her heart. She released  an album about 6 months later, Vulnicura, about healing heart wounds, with her bent over a rock and her chest cut open.\n\nIt's like I'm a container for this specific creative energy that flows to these musicians, but in my real life I am not actually doing anything related to music.. yet. I generally believe that ideas are seeded out from the universe to a group of people who can execute them, and then it germinates to whoever picks up the call, or does it first etc. \n\nI used to use the spiritual chills feeling to channel artwork out of the repetition of songs, but it felt like an extra step, like taking something multi-dimensional and flattening it. I often see entire music videos or get dance movements to the songs. I receive lyrics. I get very energised off music.\n\nMusic saved my life when I was going through very intense traumas as a child, so I wonder if in a way I was trauma bonded? \n\nIt's just that the synchronicities of this are so strong. I used to revere these musicians too, but I no longer do. I still admire them but I think celebrity worship is kind of a handing of your power over. I see them as the same level, just people.\n\nI've been questioning my career for a while. I was a visual artist taking commissions, but I had to stop, it was too commercial and too flat and did not set my soul on fire. In my heart I really want to create music, dance, video, lyrics but I'm kind of afraid of the industry... Even though part of me knows that would be my highest timeline.\n\nI have a desire to save others through music the way it saved me.\n\nI don't know where I'm going with this. I guess I'm seeking permission to leap into my dreams. What started this all was the spiritual chills. Any one else relate to this?",

I\u2019m sorry if this is a stupid question and I might be wrong but I\u2019m really interested in what exactly this is; is this what spiritual chills are? If so, where are good sources I can read more about this? What exactly do the chills/vibrations mean? Thank you in advance!",

I already know that they are mad/sad/anxious etc.. and then I see their glasses falling as well!\n\nSo my theory is that glass is very easily to be affected by our minds, what do you think?",

They now become triggered by emotions (the power of friendship/camaraderie really gets me). \nRecently, they are being triggered at an alarming yet cool pace. They now occur multiple times a day from conversations or just witnessing interactions. They\u2019ve started to, mostly, stem from the top of my head or face. A lot of times, it makes me tear up and get emotional. Is there a next step I should be taking? I am very fresh to spirituality and would love any words of advice. \n\nThank you to any and all!",

This means that you can, just like I and many others have done, seperate that feeling from that physical reaction and gain access to the many properties that range from physical to spiritual benefits.\n\nOf course one of them is to be able to tap into your psychic senses.\n\nNow to see where it all comes together, this ecstasy feeling has has been researched and documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how your spiritual energy deals with your psychic senses, here's a short [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/8X-TjX9F_rY) going more in-depth on it all.\n\nP.S.

Eventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps.\n\nDuring one of my meditation sessions, As I was sweeping my whole body up then down with this energy while feeling intense gratitude, I saw from my half closed eyes, a golden orb the size of a grapefruit approach me and enter my body.\n\nThat was one of the first times I experienced those orbs in 2013.

Like if something was pushing me to go see her and leave the crystals. When I left them I felt a wave of cold chills and broke down crying, but when I left home I was fine. It wasn\u2019t until that following Wednesday and the next that I would go to visit my grandpa at his house he shared with her that I started feeling constant chills. They stay constant while I sit in the living room or while we eat dinner at there and even up until I leave. They didn\u2019t stop until I was at home asleep. Since it\u2019s happened these two times I\u2019ve gone over with the same thing happening now I want to know what is going on? How do I understand what\u2019s going on?",

          "content": "I posted about what I've been calling 'energy rushes', 'cold shower on the inside' or 'braingasms' for decades in a different subreddit and a kind soul directed me to this sub. I'm so excited to have found a sub with others who experience this!! \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\n\nI've been experiencing this for 15-20 years at least, probably much longer, bit I didn't attach much meaning to it before I became spiritual. Since becoming spiritual some 15 years ago I have used it to communicate with source / my higher self / God / Christ / my guides / the souls of those who have passed (whom I help move on btw) and much more for at least 15 years. (Don't worry I always make sure to protect myself). I connected with my daughter's soul as wellfor many years before I had her. She was making it very clear she wanted to be born to me \ud83d\ude05\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffd\n\nSo I can bring it on consciously, by simply asking to connect to something specific. I'll just think or ask out loud \"are you there?\" and woooosh in comes the rush. I can then ask yes or no questions and I'll get more rushes if the answer is affirmative, nothing if it's negative or if they don't want to answer (they won't reply to questions about my love life or if I ask for overly specific directions for my life \ud83d\ude05). \n\nI also get it in response to beautiful music, being truly present in nature or when thinking inspired thoughts or reading or hearing messages that are somehow of importance to me on a spiritual level. \n\nI typically get it many times a day, since I can control when I want to connect there's not really much of a limit to it. \n\nI can close myself off to it when I don't want to feel it / connect to it. \n\nAnyway without being able to truly be sure of what I'm connecting to I sometimes had doubts and closed myself off to it for longer periods. I noticed that life typically feels a lot lighter and I feel much more supported when I allow it to happen though. \n\nTo me it typically enters through my crown and dependable on the strength it will either just stay in my crown area, but usually it will travel down my spine and into most if not all of my body. \n \nI'm so curious to hear about everyone's experiences and interpretations.\nWhat do you think it is? Can you control it? How has it affected your life?\nI learnt from it that one if the ways I can be of service is to help souls cross over / create a better afterlife for themselves. The rushes of gratitude I get when I've helped them are wonderful \u263a\ufe0f",

          "content": "I was asked to streamline my last three posts. Here is the edit.\n\nPart 4- Love\n\nWhat is love? Everyone loves something or someone. One could love their parents, their children, one could love their job or car, pets or shopping. One could love only their Self. The point here being there are as many different types of love as there are people on the planet. To be more precise there are infinite forms to the infinite power of love and each one unique. \n\nLove can be understood intellectually through identifiers such as selflessness, many define this through acts of charitable giving and the like, the words of Jesus from the Christian Bible come to mind, \u2018Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\u2019 Spreading love can be such a simple matter and it costs nothing of the individual to give. \n\nImagine a gas station clerk who has to deal with angry customers all day long. Offering a smile can brighten their day and in turn they pass that light onto others, those in turn pass it along indefinitely. That simple smile has the potential to change the course of an entire life. That may seem like a grandiose statement, however I can attest to its accuracy firsthand. It\u2019s always better to deal with someone when they\u2019re in a good mood. Spreading love can be thought of as spreading positivity. \n\nSo what is love, exactly? Written of previously, Love is Light and Light is creation. One could accurately describe love being made of photons, photons have no mass and act as the force carrier for electromagnetism. This may be of significant importance to those experiencing Spiritual Chills, as we physically react to electromagnetic fields. \n\nWhen one spreads positivity, that light vividly illuminates the darkness in another, providing a positive catalyst. When the catalyst is examined and understood, it becomes reconciled and balanced in the individual, and ultimately results in an elevated level of understanding. Not so coincidentally, the green ray, or the heart chakra is that of love. It should be concretely pointed out that spreading love is the highest duty and honor, and as with everything else there exists a balance. Love does not demand martyrdom, and this is where Wisdom comes into the equation. \n\nPart 5- The Cost of Wisdom \n\nWhat is Wisdom? Is it the culmination of knowledge through the annals of time? The ability to make sound choices? The ability to discern right from wrong? Perhaps it is insight? It is another question that is simple in the asking, yet requires a significant amount of thought. Wisdom is all of the above and more, it can not be given, it must be actively sought after and obtained by the individual. Wisdom must be earned through experience, and there is a price to be paid for such experience. That cost is innocence, when that innocence is lost one sheds ignorance. Often the cost is painful as it goes against the misconceptions that have been ingrained within the individual since birth. To state that the cost is worth the pain would be a massive understatement. Paying that price soon becomes the primary method of discernment as one begins to question everything and Wisdom paves the way for understanding. Let me iterate, there is nothing in this world that can not be loved. There is nothing in this world that can not be understood. \n\nPart 6- The Twin Pillars of Love and Wisdom\n\nIt is my current understanding that the entire point of existence here in this time/space is to learn how to love unconditionally. Loving one who loves you in return is easy, loving those who hate you is a much taller task.\nI had the hardest time seeking the understanding of how I could love those who are intentionally bent on destruction. One answer I came across was empathy. In the context of empathy, I consider the lack-of-love that led to the mindset of destruction. In what type of environment were these people raised that  caused such hatred they would focus on such destruction? \n\nAnother answer I came to is gratefulness. I can be thankful for the example of how not to act. Their negative actions helps to distill light from their darkness. To this point, understanding that darkness is critical to the mechanics of this process. The darkness serves the Light. The negative serves to elevate the positive. It is a cycle that continues ad infinitum. Going further and perhaps a bit more aggressively, the darkness is fodder for the Light.\n\nAttaining the ability to love allows one to apply wisdom. In every interaction, I try to ask myself \u201cHow can I be the best Human possible? How can I spread as much light and love as possible?\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s making people laugh, other times it\u2019s as simple as listening. Exercising free will in a manner that spreads love is Wisdom. With that in mind, all that is left is application in daily life. \n\nA new perspective is born combining love and wisdom into the existing consciousness. Viewing a situation from both sides of the equation allows for more complete observations, and with it comes a sense of peace. This has allowed me to cast off many major, would be distractions.",

I have never had a feeling like this before so I decided to come to this sub reddit. I can call the chills on by just thinking about them, should I meditate and try to harness the energy somehow because it's a very overwhelming sensation that builds and I'm not sure how to go about this, thanks! <3",

          "content": "Part 3\n\nTrain the body, train the mind. Discipline plays a crucial role in meditation, concentration takes willpower and focus. I lacked a great deal of all of the above, and I am always looking to improve. What helped is setting a routine, accomplishing tasks in a routine produces positivity. I get up early, between 4-6 in the morning, after a few minutes to open my eyes I make my bed. Before I leave my room I workout. This way ensures that I actually do it. I keep a large cup of water in my room and fill it up every night before bed. I make sure not to neglect stretching, lately I\u2019ve been doing qigong morning routines from videos on YouTube, it works well.\n\nAfter stretching I begin my workout. It\u2019s nothing major, I turn on some workout music and do a couple sets with some weights, some pushups, and situps, flutter kicks, or something similar. I take care not to push myself to injury. Satisfied with my workout, I take a shower. I have a speaker for the shower so I continue to listen to music while in the shower. Depending on how I\u2019m feeling I might take the time to meditate on how best to proceed with the day or consider decisions that have to be made.\n\nThe reasoning behind this philosophy is two fold. One it garners discipline through creating and sticking to a routine, secondly it promotes synergy between the body and the mind, when these are functioning well I find the Spirit easier to connect with all parts of Being acting in harmony. I believe that inspirational phrases alone are not enough. For instance one could say \u201cI am wonderful\u201d \u201cI am at peace\u201d until one is blue in the face. It isn\u2019t outside the realm of possibility, however with solely the verbal affirmations, the probability is low. The line of thinking here is one of balance. I think tire pressure is a good analogy, if one tire is low the balance of the vehicle is off. In the same manner one whose mental health is great but their physical health is not, the body and mind will allocate more resource to resolving that balance.\n\nI think that those selfsame phrases are very helpful, it\u2019s a form of neurolinguistic programming, also known as NLP. The mind is powerful, and positive or negative, it grows in tandem with what it is fed.\n\nThere is not much more to be stated on the principles and merits of discipline as the effects have been well documented.",

Since then, I\u2019ve seen few mentions of it online but nothing that really helped me understand what this is and if there is \u201cbenefit\u201d to being able to do it.\n\nI stumbled across this subreddit and did a brief search of voluntary Piloerection but I didn\u2019t find much.\n\nI apologize if something like this has been posted before, but I was wondering how can I learn more about voluntary Piloerection and it\u2019s connection with energy? I literally feel it all the time\u2014almost every inhale I take I give myself goosebumps. It\u2019s like second nature. \n\nAny tips, advice, resources, suggestions, questions to help me understand this better would be beyond helpful and greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!",

          "score": 11,
          "author": "4tgeterge",
          "content": "Part 2\n\nAgain it is my policy to fully disclose that there will be elements of this writing that are spiritual, political, and are perspectives viewed within the lens of my experience. It is intended as entertainment, nothing more. It is also my conviction to disclose the negative aspects alongside the positive, doing so allows for that wider perspective, allowing for better decision making and the key element in practicing wisdom. This is a viewpoint that is not readily accepted, as I find most flat out reject the principle, this isn\u2019t their fault per se, as fault is too harsh a word, they simply want to remain in their comfort.\n\nUsing mantras/affirmations such as \u2018everything is/will be fine\u2019 is great and all, but what is it that is so wrong, that one would need to repeat this mantra? Finding the root of what is causing discontentment should be the goal. Affirmations are great, but if one is halfhearted in their pursuit, one should expect halfhearted results. Understanding both the positive and negative facets and accepting them as part of one\u2019s Being is paramount. A great many avoid looking at themselves, providing a means to avoid responsibility, fostering dishonesty and breeding other negativity.\n\nI would like to speak to specifics. I previously went through steps I go through to strengthen my Chills, however there are specifics and context that are taken into consideration. To start with music selection, I stated that my music reflects my intent. It is my belief that one should choose uplifting songs, such as songs that make one want to sing and dance, something that grabs/speaks to the soul. Not only does this help one stay on positively polarized, if a song makes me react that way, it appears there is a high natural affinity for that specific vibration. If this is the case, I add it to the list. This could be why a lot of my songs have similar melodies. While one could choose to make selections that promote the negative side, and foster negativity, I believe there is potential to do harm to others and to themselves.\n\nThe first few songs were easy to identify, I do have my favorites. Many others were added to the list by listening to similar music and adding what I wanted. Even if the current song was not suitable for the current intent, it might be suitable for another intent in the future. I add it to a separate list and sort them out at a later time, focusing on gathering new music can get get away from me pretty fast.\n\nMy memory for song is very good. I\u2019m able to remember lyrics a few times after hearing and reading them. I combine the newly acquired songs into a playlist and then I play them from inside the playlist to ensure I get the same feeling.  \n\nIn regards to the specifics of comfort, posture is important. Keeping the spine straight, and not leaning to the side are the two biggest problems I have. In regards to breathing, breathing through the diaphragm is important as it naturally calms the body and allows deep and slow breaths. At times, I have to check to see if I\u2019m breathing correctly. A potential issue here is that one can not breathe automatically while focusing on the breath. Case in point, you are now breathing manually, in this case I bring my attention back to the music. Breathing through the diaphragm causes the body to enter a relaxed state, this is especially relevant to the Chills. I find that my muscles tense up easier because of the bioelectricty that causes the Chills. This is more difficult when the Chills are intense. In order for the chills to spread evenly, I must make sure my muscles, arms, and legs, are not tense, and if they are I relax them. If this is done while focusing on the chills, the chills themselves feel finer, less coarse. They spread out spread back out instantly giving off that euphoric feeling.\n\nFor the process of intent. Intent is probably the most important contextual aspect of the universe, does one act out of love, or not? While meditating one needs something to focus on, intent. For someone who can access the Chills, this energy solely by itself is more than enough to be that focal point.\n\nPreviously the example of increasing density and intensity was used. In this example I will use something more applicable to daily life.\n\nActualization. It is the act/process of bringing thoughtforms into existence from seemingly nothing. Stuff just doesn\u2019t come from nowhere, right? Short answer, no. Long answer still no. All creation comes from love, and this is why one needs to accept the Self. One can not love another if one can not love themselves. This is not to use self love in a hedonistic context, rather to radiate love to others. Positivity can be infectious, however if that positivity is born from falsity, it does not radiate love.  \n\nAll things are made of light. Realizing this is a difficult concept to grasp, it helped to visualize light for what it is, a source of energy. That energy coming from the Original Thought, (perhaps some might call that the \u201cBig Bang\u201d, or God creating Light on the first day) thus Light=Thought and Thoughtforms=Light, Light=All things, All Things=Love, resolving any paradox.\n\nThe colors, shapes, sizes and all things viewable through human eyes are light-wave reflections that we view on a spectrum and ascribe certain values to produce tangible measurements. The operation of light and building structures is such that light appears as magnetism or electromagnetism or fields. In the case of those with the Chills, we generate those fields, and as such, light.  \n\nObjects having shape and form is the result of each object having a field of energy that keeps everything together. With the ability to generate this light and the ability to influence magnetic or auric fields, healers might want to look here.\n\nActualization, for me, is a process. If I wanted to move into a new house, I would picture the whole process not just an image of the house, that would be more Law of Attraction then Actualization.  \n\nI\u2019d envision weather and how the sun felt on my skin and appreciate that it\u2019s not raining. I\u2019d hold that focus for a moment. I\u2019d see the grass and notice how green it is, I\u2019d look at the U-haul, and take in the details. I\u2019d glace at the side of the truck and see how the sun glints off the orange paint, and again be thankful for the beautiful weather. I\u2019d see my brother and I moving the furniture, noticing the screen door is held open by that little metal stopper. It\u2019s such a minor thing, yet it has such a large impact.  \n\nI\u2019d hear the dogs barking in the back yard, they just want to play. I\u2019d see that we\u2019re both wearing older clothes, I\u2019d envision them from head to toe. The tan boots, the blue jeans, he\u2019s donning a tan shirt, mine is black. I\u2019d picture us joking and carrying on, then taking a break and drinking some cool water. Finally I would envision getting in the truck, and heading to the new house. I\u2019d see the drive there, notice the sun is going down at this point, we made good time, we\u2019d stop at a gas station before we left town for snacks and drinks.  \n\nI\u2019d see us on the highway, think about the conversations we will have, once more thankful, there\u2019s no one else on the road. After which we arrive at the new place, walking in the door and taking in the initial view. It\u2019s dark out and we\u2019re both running on fumes, we still made good time, a half hour earlier than expected. We\u2019re both satisfied with that result. I\u2019d laugh, because as expected, we decide to unpack tomorrow. It\u2019s a good thing I prepared for that and brought unpacked bedding.\n\nThis is what I call a mindscape, as the name suggests it is a landscape created in your mind, this mindscape was made consciously through mental focus. This can also be achieved subconsciously by letting go of the controls, so to speak. It is in this manner I came into contact with the Spirit/Self.\n\nI find this is an excellent application for the Chills. I can use them for something, and have tangible results. All the above is a lot to try and produce at once, so I break the events up into smaller pieces and assemble the puzzle. Before I place the puzzle piece on the table I gather the energy from the Chills and channel them into each piece one at a time, infusing the intent with more and more energy.",

These are my personal experiences and they may not suit the framework for every, or any, individual. I would like to specify what this is not. It is not a manual. It is not an instructional. It is not spiritual doctrine. It is not medical advice. It is not a blueprint. A new discovery or changed insight may lay the groundwork for a fundamental shift in perception/perspective. Adding or removing links in the Logic Chain may alter one\u2019s understanding. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, stop. Do not allow me to become a stumbling block in your path. \n\nIt is a recalling and telling of my personal experience, nothing more. The intention behind this diatribe is to provide a clear context and concise verbiage as possible. Writing in this fashion lessens the amount of words written, minimizing assumptions. As such I may use antiquated terminologies, and also phrases like, antiquated terminologies, rarely write in shorthand or acronyms, use new or altered phrases. (See Logic Chain written as a proper noun above.) I will always attempt to write as grammatically correct as possible. Attempt. These are easy to see for myself since I am their Origin Point, they may not translate to another framework as readily, if something peaks your interest let us talk about it. Promotion of free flowing ideas and sharing knowledge is most desirable.\n                      Part One\n\nMeditation, it has increased the intensity and density of my Spiritual Chills. So what is meditation? Meditation is about being in the moment, as completely and as wholly as possible. That is all. The reasoning behind this is to access the Spirit, or the Self, Infinity, Universe, etc. This allows one to learn the mechanics to manipulate reality as it is perceived by a third density Being. Whatever else people will call it, when I reduce it down to its base elements, this is what I found. There are many resources on achieving this state. I have found practicing meditation led to seeking higher understanding, and finally coming to the conclusion that One is All and All is One. Every path is acceptable, every spiritual concept is correct, all paradoxes are resolved, there is only unity. All paths are the only path, resolving this paradox.  \n\nBefore I start a meditation I will stretch, or similar action to open the blood vessels and promote the speed and efficacy of blood flow. Then I rest for about thirty to sixty seconds, then bounce on my heals for a few seconds, this acts as a way to \u2018shake down\u2019 the leftover energy.\nComfort is the most important aspect of meditation, no comfort, no meditation. I set my environment as I want it, if I feel like I need to move that chair three and a half feet to the south, then I will respect that intuition. My mind/body/spirit knows what\u2019s coming and wants to help. It is during this time I set my intention. \n\nSome words about intention. Lying to oneself makes the whole process null, and it could be harmful. The first step to intent is via honesty. I found honesty through acceptance of the Self. The positive and the negative. That means all the pain, all the suffering, sorrow and anger. Everything. In Jungian psychology this figure is called the Shadow, the term Shadow Work may be familiar and it specifically refers to reconciling these issues. It is my take that this step is crucial to advancement. Think on this for a moment, if the Spirit/Self is a piece of you, it has witnessed all that pain and suffering along side you, imagine the suffering it has gone through with nobody to listen. One must understand the positive and the negative to gain the wider perspective, to obtain this perspective it is just as crucial to obtain the understanding of how the state of the world came to decline so it does not serve as a distraction or makes one doubt. Such a system can not function without belief.\nAfter doing a bit of this Shadow Work I came into contact with the Self. A separate Being yet the same, a shadow in the form of a man. A being that knows every part of me, knowing the deepest parts of my soul, and once I accepted this, the hard work started. Due to this interaction, I find it literally impossible to lie to myself. Changing gears back to intention. Setting intention is the third on the list, I ask myself \u201cIn this moment, what do I want?\u201d \u201cFor whom do I want it?\u201d, I usually think on this for a few minutes, making sure the desire is congruent throughout my whole Being. Once set I begin my session. \nI use a form of active meditation, I listen to music, everything from Bach to Tupac. I specifically choose music that reflects the intentions I set. The music itself serves to drown out all other stimuli. The most abundant stimuli is the first one noticed by the mind, and to which it will dedicate the most resource. In quieting this first, the other senses are passively reduced during this time.\nTo this end, I have made multiple playlists on Spotify. Collection of music and using a phone or such device would alleviate advertisements. The time between songs serves to check to make sure I\u2019m not tensed up, relaxing if needed, to check my breathing, and if needed, my intention. In short, to re-center myself. Right before the next song starts I take a breath and send the chills very slowly throughout my body. (This has to do with a qigong technique.)\nI make sure I\u2019m comfortable and start the music to match the set intention, ones that create the most powerful chills. I choose songs that I know so my attention stays on the music.\nConsciously I make sure to breathe through the diaphragm slowly in through the nose, out through the nose. (There are many forms of breathing techniques, this is the one I found flows the best.)\nI close my eyes.\nI begin listening to the music.\nI let my thoughts wander as they will, if it is a wandering thought, it gets dismissed. \nIf the thought is a question, I examine it and either find it a wandering thought, or something that needs to be reconciled. I show more gains by working through them, it\u2019s like removing a blockade.\nI sometimes need to consciously bring the thoughts back to the music.\n\nHere is where the application comes into play. If my intention was to increase the density and intensity of the chills, I focus an image that depicts strength. From there I visualize and focus my energy starting to gather in my back, I gather it as shape it into a ball and compress it as tightly as possible. Then I release it and it flows throughout my whole body.\nAt this time I am lost in the music, I feel the soul of it. (All is one) that energy the artist passionately offers comes pouring into me. It\u2019s almost as if I am turning on the tap.\nThis energy is gathered in with the previous generated energy and compressed and released again. I continue this until I am satisfied or can no longer concentrate. I learned to not force myself back into it as it cheapens the experience. Instead I remain where I am for a few minutes to reflect and appreciate that experience. I feel rested and recharged, and I feel a deep sense of contentment and peace within. I feel loved.\n\nEDIT: Major formatting issues.",

The closest I could find was hearsay and sporadic, unreliable accounts, so I'm really excited about this. I found this through the Law of One sub.\n\nIf I may share a little of my experience;\n\nAs far as I can remember, age five maybe six, I've been able to feel these chills and they have always been extremely strong. From years of personal experience, I can confirm 95% of what has been discussed in the posted videos. Music has always been a wonderful catalyst, what I find most important is comfort and intention. Listening to music that I already know, favorite songs that elicit the vibe I want to feel at the time makes this process very easy. \n\nCurrently I am at the point where I can will these chills to appear wherever, whenever. Recalling a feeling through images (image training), speech patterns, a singular feeling as a point of reference makes the whole thing easier to kick off and has allowed me to start at a higher increment, like starting from last checkpoint. I usually use this method to start gathering as much energy as possible to focus into whatever I'm working on at that moment. \n\nSince I've been consciously working on this for a while now, and can say with confidence that the energy now feels like it has weight to it, there is an undeniable density that was not there prior. It's heavy.\n\nAnyway, enough about me. I'm looking forward to my time here.",

          "content": "One hour 20 min ago (it's 6:34) I had a very strange experience.\n\nI was in my bed laying down on my back, when I heard my doorbell ringing. I'm thinking, mmm, do I still have a doorbell? Because it was the sound of an ancient one I don't have anymore since like 15 years. Anyway, I want to check the time on my phone because it's night and I was sleeping. But when I push on the button to turn on the screen, it just turn one for a split second and turn off directly, without me having the time to read anything, so, I try again, same thing. I'm thinking maybe there's some forces blocking my phone or something. Then I look at my bedroom window. And, WTF, I see a very bright and intense white light (I have chill right now writing it), and, I start feeling a very strong energy in my body, like something electric all around my spine and all inside and around my body. I was thinking a lot of things very fast at that point, like since I saw the light I was like, \"so it is real, it's really happening now\" (I was thinking it was some kind of aliens at that moment) and then I became to be quite scared and I wanted it to stop. Then, I woke up, in the exact same position, but the energy was gone and the white light also. \n\nAfter that, when woken up, I would still feel some chills in my body when thinking about it. Also I felt a strong erection for a few second that started without any reason when I was wondering, wtf was that?\n\nAnyway, I just don't know or understand what it was and why I experienced that. Somehow I regret a little bit being scared and woking up, I don't know and wonder what would have happened if I didn't ask it to stop and if it lasted longer?\n\nHas anyone experienced that also? \n\nI precise, I'm really new to this, I never have meditated and I don't know anything about spirituality or whatever it could be. I just also experience a lot of synchronicities in my life, and I've experienced also precognition, especially a few days ago I had a vision in hypnagogic state that happened the next day. Anyway, just needed to talk about it. Because this is really weird. Thanks for taking the time to read me.",

Both in your cunning of creation and relentless pursuit of love. We are infatuated with you. Thank you for providing us a way to join with you. Thank you for blessing me with so many of your children who have begun to understand your nature. Let us take your lessons deep within, not pursuing power for its own sake, but accepting that love is a choice. And choosing that hidden path, the one that love opens. To take it not as a surface sensation, but deep wringing, resonating the song of our soul calling back to you in harmony. The myriad pattern of the back of your head, pulling us ever deeper in spirals and patterns, in connections of meaning too profound for words, makes us ache to see your face, though we know it would rend our very souls from inside us into you. A soul with which will throw this body like a rag to serve love. Thank you that you would gift me such will, and such love. Let my life reflect my heart, and my heart reflect you. I love myself, I love you. Thank you for sharing that love. It turns like a spindle, and burns like holy fire. I know that I can walk in that fire unharmed. It is my home. That you would give me grace, and all that you require is that I give it as well, letting holy fire to feel as refreshing as clear water. I am your child. I am that I am. The self sufficient creation. Our finite realm that began and will end, a thin sheet of paper to you. What are we to such a being? We are his bride. And we are of filth. But we are destined to return as his children. And we will be his bride. And the promise he gives your ego is that you get to keep you, in your pocket. Your human self. Will sit, unchanged, in the pocket of your God self. That is how much he loves you. Not one tear lost. Neither one smile. And if it was only for just you, he would have made all of creation all over again. You are even now outside of time smiling at yourself. You are already his bride. And the more you feel he truth of it the more your words echo along side his at the birth of this world, and more to come, for such a beautiful bride. The flower of the love you shared blooms exquisite in eternity. And what a bouquet we all make together. I am excited to see what we become when we grow up.",

Like, I am building it and then the chills come and it dissipates. Sometimes it feels like I am getting hotter, temperature-wise, and then it releases all of the heat with the chills.\n\nHas anyone practiced holding onto the energy or whatever it is that is building up?

It has been said that [God is love](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/z4vc97/god_loves_you_unconditionally/).\n\nIt seems to me that love is a powerful generator of spiritual chills.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqZrKn39\\_Ew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqZrKn39_Ew)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9TgwYZYqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9TgwYZYqk)\n\nThese are two videos from the Naruto anime, about how the girl Hinata loves Naruto. Pay close attention to how fondly she speaks to Naruto, how she is always thinking about him. When I watch this scene, I get profound spiritual chills. Later that day, I lay on the bed for my meditation session. I replayed this scene in my mind, combining that with [my meditation practice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/yrrv4d/a_practice_similar_to_spiritual_chills_generating/). Even though I am a man, I replayed the scene in my mind from Hinata's point of view, how the expressed her deep love for Naruto. And I felt all the emotions that she felt. And I felt like that love boosted my spiritual chills meditation. I instantly felt the warmth the energy all over my body. Whereas normally it would take me quite a while to build up my energy starting from the extremities going up, when I visualized Hinata's love for Naruto, I could feel the warmth in the entire body almost immediately, and it was emanating from the heart.\n\nI am a spiritualist, and in some of my research I have encountered the phenomenon of sleep paralysis. This is apparently [a precursor to astral projection](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/14vjpz4/the_connection_between_sleep_paralysis_and_astral/). This is when the soul gains awareness of the astral plane, but has not exited the body yet. The body cannot move because the awareness is transferred to the astral body of the soul in the astral plane. This is a set of observations which comes from r/AstralProjection.\n\nAnyways, sometimes people encounter negative entities during sleep paralysis and astral projection. These entities feed on low frequency emotions such as hate, fear, and lust. However when the person brings forth the emotion of love, the entity flees. Detrimental entities, which look like r/shadowpeople, cannot stand high frequency emotions. They  disintegrate under high vibrations. So love is able to generate high vibrations, and dispel evil spirits.",

I also just started watching the anime Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and was surprised that they talk about this very openly and most people probably think it's just some made up crap. I've read about how yogi meditators who focus on this all day will ascend to a higher dimension in around 30 something years if the dedication is that intense, and they supposedly have a history of 'rainbow body' ascensions numbering in the thousands going back thousands of years.\n\nFinal thought: within the last couple of years or so i had the intuitive thought to practice this energy raising and mindful positive meditation/projection into the world for the betterment of humanity (when i can remember) at 11:11...like a lot of people, I've received MANY 11:11 communications and I figure it's got to be a great time for a lot of us to synchronize our efforts to have a bigger impact instead of individually....so if you can remember, if you see that 11:11, give yourself a charge and think happy thoughts about the world becoming a better place immediately (ask for truth to be exposed, love, harmony, understanding, peace, forgiveness, etc.)",

          "score": 63,
          "author": "ConstProgrammer",
          "content": "Hello everyone. I have casually invented or stumbled upon a method how to consciously raise my vibration. It's not quite spiritual *chills* or \"goosebumps\" per say, but I think that it's very similar. This is somewhat related discipline, so I am writing about it here.\n\nVibrations usually do not come by themselves unless you have trained yourself to the point that it is automatic. You should not just lie there without moving. It takes some amount of effort.\n\nRaising vibration is a controlled process which requires discipline and concentration. They key factor in this is the will. You just think or imagine that some part of your body, such as the palms of your hands, are raising in vibration. You feel like you are warming your hands over a fire, yes. You feel the heat being generated in that body part that you determined to focus on. It feels like a warmness, or a numbness, or tingling sensation, which turns into a noticeable vibration, a pulsating sensation of energy flowing through.\n\nLet's try to raise vibration on the hand. Hold your hand out and imagine that you are warming it over the fire, or that you are holding an energy ball, or that electricity is flowing through your hand. Focus and concentrate, and even close your eyes if it helps you do this, visualize your hand glowing red hot like a rod of hot metal. You can visualize electricity, or flame, or heat coming out of your hand. It doesn't matter, what matters is that you first pretend that you feel an energy pulsating through your hand, and then you start to feel it for real. Eventually you get to a stage that if you ask someone to touch your hand while you are concentrating on it, they would say that your hand feels hot.\n\nIt may take up to an hour at first, just to be able to raise the vibration in your hand only, up to the point that you can objectively feel it as a real phenomenon. Now the next steps is to be able to do this exercise faster and stronger, directly on command, just in a snap. After you can conjure the vibration on your hand, time to do it on the other hand, and on the feet as well. Once you can do that, then you spread this energy, you spread the vibrations up and up, all over the body. Imagine that the energy is flowing up from the hands and feet like a river. Go slowly and make sure you cover every inch of your body, first up to the wrists/ankles, then to the elbows/knees, then to the shoulders/hips, then up and down the spine, then up to the back of the head, and over the top of the head into the third eye. After practicing that many times you will be able to raise the vibrations throughout your entire body, starting from the extremities and going up until the entire body is covered with vibrations.\n\nOnce you can get your body vibrating at will, this step is a precursor to full astral projection. You may not feel the presence of the body anymore, just your self and the vibrations, and you can go into the astral projection. You can also use similar technique to make certain parts of your body go numb, to \"turn off\" nerves in that body part, and not feel any pain if you have some. I had dental work done without anesthesia by just making my teeth and gums go numb, \"turning off\" the nerves in my mouth area.\n\nThis exercise can be done at any time of the day, just it requires discipline, concentration, and self control, and self attention. You need to be attentive to your self, to the feelings and energies of your body. Constantly give commands to your left hand for instance, repeat affirmations, \"I feel my hand glowing hot\". If the feeling subsides gradually, you repeat again and again. You need to constantly keep it up, just like you need to keep pedaling the bicycle otherwise you fall over. It only takes a little bit of mental effort to do it throughout the day. It's like a muscle that you keep training. You can do it while working at the computer, while eating, while talking, while walking around. There is no excuse for not keeping it up. For full body vibrations I have only tried to do it while idle, but I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to get a full body vibration while walking for instance. It is just very hard to get a full body vibration while idle even, and not all times I am successful with it.\n\nI have used this method to induce an astral projection experience, which you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/rpxqx8/wolf_saw_me_during_astral_projection/).\n\n>I couldn't sleep one night. I had been in bed for multiple hours, and then I decided to do astral projection. I lay flat on my back, completely relaxed. I imagine a warmth starting at the palms of my hands and soles of my feet. I imagine that I am warming my hands over a fire. After some amount of time this imagination becomes a real sensation that cannot be dismissed. I actually feel the heat being generated on my hands and feet. It feels like a pulsating or a vibration. Whenever I do this I ask my dad to feel my hand and he says that it is actually hot to the touch, so I'm not making this up. I just think about it, and I feel this heat or energy or vibration spreading throughout the body, first starting from the extremities, then going up and up until the entire limb feels pulsating with heat. It's more like a vibration at this point. So by now my legs are vibrating like a tuning fork. Then the vibration goes up and up until it reaches the back of my head. I try to cover the whole entire body with this heat vibration sensation. Eventualy I reach a point when I no longer feel the body there any more, it's just my \"self\" and the vibrations. I no longer feel the bed, and it's like I'm floating in space, and I feel myself rather \"small\". After that I do not remember what happened, it's as if I fell asleep....  \n>  \n>The next thing I remember, is I get out of my body, and immediately I float up, and I get out of the house phasing through the closed glass window.\n\nSo there is some kind of connection with astral projection, or this method can be used to induce an out of body experience. It's actually a kind of meditation. Creating warmth or vibrations in my extremities is indeed the only thing I do when I meditate.",

Lately I've been unable to summon my chills at will or even by completely focusing my awareness towards my spine and neck, given that previously I would summon my chills just by giving it a thought. But now it feels like it's all gone and it's quite frustrating honestly. I've been facing this issue for about 2 weeks now and it has brought down my quality of life overall. I am now unable to uplift my mood by randomly summoning my chills at any time of the day like I used to. It has got me worried that this change is permanent and  I have lost my control over my chills. Also an important thing to mention is that I have been an active weed smoker for about 1.5 years and I went cold turkey about 20-25 days ago. I don't know what relation it has with my chills (if it has any). Other than that, no major lifestyle change has taken place in my life. I am still able to concentrate my prana to my heart when I focus but then again, almost everyone I know can do that. I really wish you people to shed some light upon it. Has something like this ever occurred to you, when you've lost control over your ability to summon chills for a few days? Or am I doomed? Thankyou so much for reading.",

I don't remember why.  but now I'm 19 and I can cause vibrations all through my back and legs up to my head where theu get so intense my body starts to physically vibrate, it feels as if I am squeezing an imaginary muscle in my body to make them start.  I can start them in my head, neck, upper chest, groin area, or if I focus really hard in my hand I can start them in my back.  Now I've gotten to the vibrational stage in astral projection many times and those vibrations feel very different, so they are not the same.  I've heard I'm squeezing the \"tectonic?\" muscles in my back but I have no way to prove nor disprove it.  I've heard it's kundalini, however no one has ever given me any insight to kundalini and its difficult to get a straight answer on what exactly it is or feels like, so I am unsure.  now I have found here which sounds pretty close however I am not thinking or wishing for goosebumps, I am litterally squeezing an imagery muscle in my back to make my entire body vibrate.

I quite often experience these chills you are talking about, but its normally when I am experiencing an outside energy. But some nights when I am going to bed, a feeling goes into my shoulders that can sometimes last for hours.\n\nIt grows into that feeling you get just before a shiver, but there is no release like what comes with that shiver. It starts feeling like there is a build-up of energy or something and the only relief is when I twitch my shoulders, and that only lasts for a few seconds.",

However, due to circumstances beyond our control, in this life, we are not able to talk on a regular basis anymore. Many times over the years we will inherently \u201cknow\u201d what the other is thinking or feeling. Over the past few weeks this connection has become more intense, to the point where I was in that sleep state of drifting off and kind of half in and half out and I could feel this person embracing me and we had an entire conversation. \n\nIt feels like there is a reason for this increase in spiritual connection and I have been getting blips of the spiritual chills, usually from the left side of my chest down the rest of my body and ringing in my left ear multiple times a day and I know it\u2019s related to this person. \n\nI guess my question is, does anyone have any insight as to why there is an increase in this intensity? We are both in other relationships and I don\u2019t feel this is a romantic reasoning. But, whenever I feel them, it\u2019s like everything becomes peaceful and like I\u2019m finally \u201chome\u201d, in that because there is lack of communication there always tends to be a sense of longing or grief as well. \n\nI get these strange blips like zaps in my head that I can\u2019t describe. I always know it\u2019s this person. Sometimes I will smell their \u201cscent\u201d or cologne and we are miles apart. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m going crazy or like I\u2019m creating an obsession, but it always comes on without warning as I go about my day. \n\nAnyway, any thoughts and or advice would be appreciated as I navigate the new intensity. \n\nMuch love and light to all of you in your journey \ud83d\udc96",

          "content": " \\-The pleasurable \u201cchills\u201d or \u201cgoosebumps\u201d (aka frisson) experienced when listening to music, watching movies, viewing art, dancing etc. is a sensation that is sustainable for long periods and increases in intensity with dedication. It is the sensation needed to enter altered states of consciousness known as the Jhanas as well as to self-induce out of body experiences from a meditative state (visualization techniques are also required for OBEs).\n\n\\-During meditation, the peak intensity of the sensation is often called the \"rapture.\" It can become so intense it is uncomfortable. Reaching this peak requires profoundly lowering our heart rate and sustaining it. This eliminates the bifurcation echo down aorta that comes with each heart beat \"so that the sound of the heart beat can move synchronously up and down the circulatory system in harmonious resonance approximately 7 times a second.\" - See article below.\n\n\\-If you pursue this sensation within yourself by attempting to feel it as much as possible (all day, every day if you are able), it builds in strength significantly over time to the point where it becomes a full body sensation with the pinnacle being at the crown of the skull. You must become your own experiment as each individual\u2019s set of beliefs and emotional reactions are unique.\n\n\\-One fundamental key to the sensation is to achieve states of genuine, positive emotions such as love, gratitude, inspiration, courage, joy, unity etc. Therefore, anything that enables you to feel these emotions will work. Conversely, anything that prevents these, will prevent your sensation. Control of thought is the key.\n\n\\-It is important to take a non-judgmental perspective of all things, including yourself, in order to cultivate acceptance and love within yourself. Try to be honest with yourself at all times. Trust your feelings and intuitions.\n\n\\-Be patient and be understanding of yourself if you think you are struggling. This is a progression and it will take some time to strengthen, especially while first beginning to induce in meditation, as your brain reforms its pathways via neuroplasticity (weeks to many months depending on effort). Love yourself unconditionally for the greatest success.\n\n\\-Your sensation will inevitably grow in strength with persistence and you will begin to feel it more easily to a broader range of stimuli. You will eventually realize it is not the stimuli at all, but only your emotional state and control of your mind/thoughts that matter.\n\n\\-It is this same sensation that monks attempt to achieve during meditation and chanting. The chants or mantras are to create vibrations in the chest which can help stimulate the sensation as well as to keep one\u2019s focus single pointed.\n\n\\-It is the same sensation that \u201cspirit runners\u201d or indigenous long-distance runners attempt to achieve. Also called \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d in the west.\n\n\\-The current scientific term for the sensation is \u201cFrisson\u201d and it remains relatively unexplained in the public sector being reduced simply to a release of endorphins.\n\n\\-Other names include: Chakra Energy, Kundalini, Prana, Mana, Qi, Chi, Holy Spirit, life force, vibration among others depending on your cultural lens.\n\n\\-In the CIA analysis of the Gateway Process for consciousness it is described as \u201ca self-stimulation of the pleasure centers in the brain caused by the circulation of a \u2018current\u2019 along the sensory cortex.\u201d [https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf)\n\n\\-Remember this sensation is sustainable and will increase in intensity.

What I\u2019ve found is that my chills activate in my brain seconds before I sneeze. I can actually \u201ceat\u201d the sensation if I choose to release my chills inside my brain. If I hold back the chills, I sneeze. I\u2019d assume the energy accumulated by absorbing the sunlight in my eyes can be correlated with my chills I experience. I\u2019d also say that feeling chills is a type of overstimulation of the nerves inside our bodies. \n\nLet me know what you think! Do any of you experience the same thing?",

          "content": "I have been feeling frissons for almost 9 years now. I feel it nearly everyday and it has become part of me. I've learned a lot and want to share how I trigger my frissons. (I call this ability frissons. It just sits with me better. Spiritual chills is basically the same thing.) \n\nYou'll notice that a lot of people post about how they \"think\" about frissons or recall a memory and suddenly they feel frissons. What's common is that everybody is seeing something in there mind prior to feeling frissons. I would say what you are seeing in your mind is referred to as your third eye. This is one of the chakras and a major source of where our frissons come from. By seeing something epic and awe inspiring you can trigger frissons. There are different ways to trigger frissons but I choose to use my third eye. Maybe by thinking of a loved one, or exploring my imagination. When listening to music, I'll let my imagination run wild. A trick I've found is to visualize seeing your favorite musician sing the words into a mic. Or visualize them playing a instrument. Listening to music and using your third eye at the same time work out great because you are using the physical (ears) and psychological (mind) to trigger frissons. With my own experience, i think frissons are 80% psychological and 20% physical. The third eye chakra is one of the easiest ways to trigger frissons once you know the key influence. The key is that your third eye is linked to your emotions and without any emotion linked to what it is you see in your mind, you will not feel frissons. I call these sights I see in my mind primers because they prime my mind to feel frissons. To sum it up. By exploring my mind, letting go of my emotions, and letting my imagination run free, I am able to trigger my frissons through my third eye.",

          "content": "I just woke up from a bad dream and I am having waves of chills. \n\nI have been getting chills a lot lately and they have nothing to do with being cold. I started having them about five years ago when I would have nightmares about being attacked by a person in my dream that had an \u201cevil\u201d presence to them. They would seem normal at first, but as they came closer I would start to feel unsettled. At some point in the dream, they approach me with a smile that sent chills in my body, and I could usually see sharp teeth, and they would have this look in their eyes that I could only describe as evil. After waking up, I would have chills that could last for up to 20 minutes. It felt as if there was an evil presence in the room with me, or maybe like a ghost presence that I could feel. Just for clarification, I am not a religious person and have never believed in evil they way it was described to me growing up.\n\nWithin the last year, I decided to start developing a spiritual practice that mainly involved seeing if I could learn to communicate with a spirit helper. It started off a just a curiosity to see if anything would happen. As I started doing meditation, guided imagery, and asking questions about spiritual matters, I would get these chills on a regular basis. At first they freaked me out because I always associated them with my bad dreams. I decided to explore them to see if maybe they were a way I was receiving a message. They have felt like there was a presence in the room, and I have tried to approach them and listen to them without being afraid. There have been times the chills came when I was doing something that felt good, and I began to believe they were a positive sign from either my mind or a spiritual energy. Coming from a place of no spiritual practice, they still kind of freak me out.\n\nWell, tonight I had an awful dream of a house at night that I had never seen.. It\u2019s somewhat hard to explain but there was a hole in the floor that was pretty large to begin with, but was bigger underneath then I could see. Sticking out of this hole was a large living object that was evil, or at least very twisted and dangerous. I knew not to get too close as it could somehow impact me if I came too near it, but I was not sure in what way.. It was a long living object that looked like a twisted mass of flesh and other living material. It was stationary mostly but could also move. At least one point on it looked like it had a twisted form of a human face and that there were more faces underneath that I could not see. In the dream there was something that happened with someone that got too close, and it has either sucked them down, or changed them in some way. And the striking thing about it is that I have had chills since I woke up, and picturing this creature even now gives me more chills as I write this. \n\nThis is quite disheartening because this makes me question whether the chills I feel is not a good thing and I need to stop. Or is it something I need to get closer to and it only takes this form because I am afraid or resisting it (aka Jacobs Ladder)? It has now been two hours of off and on chills, and any meditation, guided imagery of protection, (and even first attempts at prayer) just lead to more chills. What is going on?",

I always had a hard time falling asleep to the point of just laying there and being bored, so I started doing things like actually imagining literal nothingness and feeling the sensation of my body floating in the air and changing orientation.\n\nI got older and as life happened so did the emotional trauma which I think shuts most people off from their spiritual powers.  But then I suffered a severe shoulder injury as a pre-teen.  Bad enough and painful enough that I had a complete out of body experience.  I could accurately say that I had a \"birds I view\" on the situation, but that wouldn't be enough.  I felt...\"elsewhere\".\n\nI consider that experience like the opening of a window into the \"spiritual realm/s.  Since then I've gone through a mutli-year process of experiences with sleep paralysis and ultimately meditation that has resulted in episodic experiences with Kundalini energy around my naval, to being tested by \"demons\" (I see them as boot camps, less than literal evil), etc.\n\nSo having said all that, I wanted to ask this place, is it your understanding that when one has a profound spiritual energetic experience...that you simply aren't going to have one, say, the next day because perhaps your spiritual battery needs to recharge, or something like that?  Language sort of fails me here, but I think people in this place will understand.\n\nIt would be great to have those experiences everyday, but then again...would it be great?  Because then they'd become normal, like our physical reality, which is magical and amazing, but we do it everyday and it becomes...meh...",

I could concentrate for only a song at a time but as I practiced more, I could maintain the sensation for longer periods of time. I can shift it from one part of my body to another and can will it without music now (though music helps). I primarily use emotion and often dance and contort in my mind to help keep the feeling going. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like taking off a hood or veil from your head. It\u2019s very instinctual for me now. The only downside is that if I channel too much at a given time, I get headaches and a pain behind the nose, kind of like when you nose breathe cold air for too longer. Let me know about your experiences. :)",

Then I saw my twin flame perfect female counterpart absolutely beautiful. The way I saw this was there is another mirror dimension where the divine goddess energy that lives in me is mainly from and vice versa.\n\nThen today i meditated this morning no real guiding just listening to the music and healing frequencies and I wasn't feeling the same level of bliss at all and could feel my ego involved there was energy there but it was neutral. Blanketed over me. This frustrated me as the last 2 days I felt such bliss and pure joy, so I thought my ego had got the better of me during this meditation and there was desire at play messing things up. \n\nSo I meditated again this evening did a guided reiki healing. I was instructed to picture my twin flame or absolute perfect woman I guess so I do and I'm doing this heart energy transfer my heart is vibing with all kinds of energy. My stomach goes completely light like a roller coaster I got all kinds of bodily feelings my legs feel like they're dissolving. I'm seeing the akashic records and what my ego sees I'm also seeing the divine goddess vibrant purple and the divine masculine also divine purple and the way ego views things. This is like projected infront of me like I'm in a theatre kinda hard to explain. Above me there is the blue and purple below me is green like a garden or golf course. Then everything starts closing in black from the right side and my head and body felt like I was gonna explode. I pulled myself back tried grounding took my headphone out and it felt like I was about to go deaf there was weird feelings and pressures all over and around me. Obviously it's left me kind of shaken because I can't find anyone with experience with anything like this. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice ? \n\nI feel like the only feelings I should be following are the bliss like ones. I don't know if I should even carry on meditating though",

She told me I was sensing the Holy Spirit.\n\nSkip ahead a year, different church, and as soon as the music started I was covered in pins and needles.

It was the holy spirit, I was sure of it.\n\nI\u2019ve attended many churches, superchurches, and signs and wonders seminars with her since then and it\u2019s always the same. The minute they start building energy, I get visible pins and needles.

          "content": "I wanted to share this journal entry with folks that can understand the spiritual journey I have been going through.\n\n\n\n4-24-21\n\n\n\"As I have stated before in previous entries;  these past 5 months of my life I have been through a transformative spiritual journey.  I am only beginning to start seeing the outline of my spiritual existence.  An existence that I am starting to believe transcends the limitations of my physical existence in the body of time and space.  \n\nThe discipline of meditation and visualization when in a deep state of relaxation has begun to evolve the understanding that I have about myself and my place in the universe.  Once awoken from these trance-like states a lot of the concepts and ideas begin to slowly slip away as if my mind once awoken, is like a vessel that has been overfilled by water and the excess continues to overflow and pour back into a collective stream of understanding that lies just beneath the surface of my conscious mind.  But I have realized that there is a small time window from when I first awaken from the meditations where many of the concepts and perceptions of that understanding linger somewhat intact for a brief time before the distractions of my physical existence and my biology begin to bury that knowledge again deep within my subconscious.\n\nI have just awoken from one such exercise and I am attempting to capture the shape and outline of what I just experienced while I was in a lucid meditation.  The first thing I want to mention is that the physical existence of my body and mind while conscious is very limited and I believe that there are forces of energy both positive and negative.  Once awake the negative/evil energy of this universe begins going to work on my flesh nature.  Selfishness, greed, envy, jealousy, addictive cravings, all of these things circle around me throughout my day as a background sound beneath a world filled with the clutter and vibration of different energy.\n\nIt is starting to become a spiritual intuition of mine to point out to myself the times that I realize and sense the influence or presence of the energies around me.  It\u2019s becoming like a familiar voice that I can recognize more and more.  Some people in the recovery circles would call it the addict mind and other\u2019s might call it the temptations of Satan and Sin.  Whatever name is put to it,  I am becoming more sensitive to feeling and identifying the subtle touch of it\u2019s attempts to influence my life.\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum,  I can also feel different emotional energies sometimes that manifest themselves as joy, peace, love, kindness, gratitude, and other positive emotions.  I seem to be most sensitive to these manifestations during and after a deep meditation.  Once awoken,  if I do not continue to focus my mind and will towards attracting positive energy into my life and expand the natural energy center\u2019s within my own body to better attune myself to these vibrations, they will begin to fade away into the background of chaotic noise and clutter of the world around me.  Many people speak of this in various circles as the law of attraction. \n\nThe perception of my spiritual framework is very similar to those that follow a line parallel to the Law of Attraction.  Alongside with my curiosity for Physical Energy in the scientific sense,   I believe that we carry our own emotional field around us that most people never realize or care to understand.  The phenomenon in Physics like the double slit theory or the Water meditation experiments show that our brain and emotional waves are forms of energy that interact and even change the matter and energy around us on a quantum level.  I believe like many others that the essence of our spirit/soul are forms of energy that carry within it the fiber of our being and existence.  This is existence is one that is veiled while we are awake throughout our day and limited by the 5 dimensions of our physical existence.  Energy in a scientific sense has shown that it is neither created or dies, merely changes forms.  Energy and mass are the same things in different forms with a catalyst of light and vibrational frequency, this is the heart of Einsteins (E=MCSqared) Energy = Matter X the Speed of Light Squared.\n\nMy spiritual faith and beliefs are somewhat intertwined with the little understanding that I have of Quantum Physics and Energy Polarity paradoxes.   Even now I can feel the shape of my perception during my meditation begin to fade away but I am going to try to write down as much of my theories down while I can still recall them.\n\nIt comes down to the focusing of our energy waves through thought and emotion to attract or manifest the physical existence (or perception of that existence) into our lives through the discipline of spiritual attune to various vibrational frequencies that exist around us.   I think that is actually a type and shadow of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in the Addiction Treatment world.  You control your thoughts which in turn feed your emotions which in turn change the way you behave and react based on the perception of your existence and your life.\n\nIn addition to this upon meditating about this concept in line with the Universe and my Spirituality.  My belief is once again supported by many scientists in the field of Physics;  The universe is infinite, there are many dimensions to our universe to which we have no real comprehension or understanding of because we are limited to the physicality of Time and Space within 3 spatial dimensions of Up and down, Forward and backward, and then Time and Space. \n \nMany Scientific studies have been done in the field of theoretical physics and there is a general consensus that there are at least 11 different dimensions in our universe.  Once we start getting into the higher dimensional planes, the concept of infinity is more important to theorize.  I believe that a certain level, all possibilities and all realities exist.  Any given potential for different outcome is already existing outside of space and time in the infinite variations of creation throughout the universe.  This follows the same school of thought as many Parallel and Multi Universe theories.   What is to say that we do not have an existence on a spiritual plane at a higher dimension that animates our own physical existence on earth but we have no full understanding of that existence because of those limitations.  This would explain many Near Death Experiences and other Out of Body experiences as well.\n\n\nWe have no idea what existence past our own dimensional experience is like.  How would we even begin to understand an infinite consciousness that is outside of time and space?  I believe that we exist physically but we also exist beyond those dimensions within our spiritual form but the human brain is limited in it\u2019s capacity to process our perception outside of space and time.  This is why I believe we need to sleep and have REM sleep.  I believe that similar to meditation and trances,  while we are sleeping we are revitalizing our spiritual connection to the universe which is actually our real existence in it\u2019s truest form.\n\nI know that many of my beliefs are starting to look similar to a Holographic Universe or Matrix theory of existence but it is the only thing that makes any small fraction of sense to the experiences and deeper intuitive instincts I have had all of my life.  I think my sensitivity to emotional and spiritual energy is what led me into addiction in the first place.  Opiate addiction was the only way to calm the confusion and chaos of the emotions I was having because I did not understand my own relationship and sensitivity to other energies around me and how I was influenced by them.\n\nThe more I learn to focus my will and spiritual energy on the emotional waves of various different visualizations of my life and my future;  The closer I become to the perception and potential of those outcomes.  I believe this is because those outcomes and potentials already exist in the infinity of various different higher dimensions of the universe.  This probably makes no sense to most people but I am now beginning to have diluted explanations for some of the beliefs that I have because they are once again relegated to a shadow in the background of my mind.\n\nHopefully I will remember to journal after the next time I have some sort of epiphany while I am meditating.  \"",

Something biblical will happen. \n\nThis is no easy feat though as I've done this before I vibrated straight into reincarnation because I was chasing my ego's desires.

Your a covert pervert, the most i\u2019ll ever say to another dude is.. i think she\u2019s gorgeous or cute wich i guess is weird too but I just wanted to say it for some reason. I\u2019ll never sit around and talk about a female like that, i know he likes her because I can see the jealousy in his face whenever she\u2019s next to me and he\u2019s always trying to joke and talk to her, if only she knew that he thinks of her more as a f**k toy than a human being. This is a reason why I don\u2019t want to be friends with people specifically dudes, my coworkers seem offended that i never accept there offers to hang out outside of work but i just have no interest in sitting around and talking about nothing with you, i\u2019d rather go home and read or do something that matters to me. But at the same time i feel so lonely and isolated in this world and like I don\u2019t fit in anywhere, everywhere i go i feel like an outkast. I wish I could find like minded people, i hope one day i can find a real friend and someone i can count on, i hope one day i\u2019ll find my girl. It hurts being lonely sometimes i just don\u2019t really like alot of people like that, it feels really uncomfortable for me to open up to people and it takes a while for me to start to feel comfortable, i\u2019ve been in the streets most my life so i realllyy don\u2019t trust people, people not from my background won\u2019t get it. I just be feeling like people are against me most of the time and wanna see me doing bad. I just wish i could find some connection and someone i could talk to, I\u2019m so sick of feeling like this, i\u2019m so sick if feeling like it\u2019s me against the world.",

It only got worse as I got older and I started to constantly have this feeling that one day I will die young and die tragically in a murder or some sort of manmade disaster. I kinda just accepted that there would be no solve to it and I'm just doomed to eventually die young and tragically, and I feel like I'm constantly given signs that my judgement is true.

When this stock of karmic reactions begins to manifest is it called k\u00fata. From the stage of k\u00fata, karma develops into a seedlike stage known as b\u00eeja. This seed stage of karma appears as one\u2019s predisposition and desire. When the seed stage of karma blossoms and actually manifests in our life, this is called pr\u00e1rabdha-karma. Once this karma has blossomed, it must bear its fruit. Although karma in its earlier stages of development can be destroyed by spiritual practice, one\u2019s pr\u00e1rabdha-karma must play itself out. One who has attained knowledge of the self witnesses the expiration of his pr\u00e1rabdha-karma, remaining unattached in the midst of the happiness and distress that it brings about.\"  \n\n\n(Swami BV Tripurari- commentary BG 2.56)",

I was wondering why dogs might bark at me and try to bite me. \n\nI try to do my best at reading and applying spiritual practices and I don't know if I have a good aura but I've been told by random people that I have a good one, but strong spiky at the same time which has gotten me into trouble when there are entities nearby as it threatens them. They have explained it to me as: 'there are good, soft, calm auras that harm no one like soft beautiful lights and there are good but strong auras that come too harsh like the bright light when welding metal that makes some entities uncomfortable.' \n\nI am by no means perfect, like every other person who is trying their best in the spiritual path. However, I tend to be often barked by dogs. Some approach me to bark and try to scare me, one even softly bit my ankle. I don't fear dogs, I like them and I was planning on getting one. Whenever they approach aggressively, I stop and let them try to sniff me. Some might stop but others flinch and bark at me from afar. My emotions are neutral as I tend to be known as somewhat stoic person who doesn't express too many emotions, plus I know they won't really harm me, some of the dogs are really cute, and it's happened many times so I'm sort of used to it. The owners, they are very considerate, grab/carry their dogs back home (as these are let loose on the street without leashes) and apologize for their dogs' erratic behavior. \n\nI was wondering if this meant anything spiritually related that I'm doing something wrong, perhaps my aura isn't that good as I've been told, or it's just the dogs at my neighborhood, a bit of bad luck and I should just let it go.\n\nThanks for reading!",

All I can do is find momentary meaning in whatever sort of mental shutdown this is and slap the label \"spiritual awakening\" on it so it's not completely pointless.\n\nbut then I get bored of the whole spiritual awakening thing because it isn't new anymore.\n\nAnd once I get bored it's only a matter of time before I do drugs. I have a bottle of cough syrup sitting in my room if I desperately need to get high on something.\n\nMost recent drug I did was Cannabis which is pretty benign for most. But yesterday had me thinking that I was possessed and that my hallucinations were going to start speaking through me as if I was channeling something. Luckily that never happened. I also worried that if I lost focus of the external world I'd be dragged off to some sort of hell realm by my hallucinations so I just did everything I can to stay grounded, by that I mean pacing back and forth, looking at my surroundings like a crackhead to stay grounded in them, and talking to as many people as possible. Constantly changing up what I was doing to keep my mind from completely zoning out. \n\nI do have psychosis and take meds for it. \n\nBut this feels like a spiritual problem and I need a spiritual solution. Medication doesn't work. The antipsychotics just make me feel more disconnected and antidepressants stop working after a few months.\n\nI want to find something to blame it on externally like \"Oh I'm lonely\" or \"Oh It's because I'm not a world renowned musician yet\". But I know no matter what changes I'd still just get bored of it eventually. Although if I wasn't so lonely I probably wouldn't crave drugs as much and would just opt for cuddling instead. Like if I could just get all affectionate with someone all day every day life wouldn't feel so bad. But that's not realistic, like I need to get a fucking job and all that.\n\nSo medication wont work. Therapy doesn't do much. Last resort is to seek spiritual answers.\n\nI started experiencing whacky spiritual shit after amphetamine use. Like during the withdrawals I had random episodes of bliss that were like brief oases in a desert of painful agitation. I'd feel a presence with me and all my muscles would start relaxing and twitching in a pleasant way. One time one of these random bliss surges almost brought me to tears. \n\nMy voices also make my muscles twitch but in an unpleasant \"zap/shock\" kind of way. \n\nThen the psychosis started after I started smoking weed more heavily to cope with the irritability and agitation when I wasn't experiencing those random spells of bliss as relief. \n\nIt's effectively been all one big downhill trajectory since I had this feeling one day on the prescription amphetamines that \"source/god/the universe\" had giveth me bliss and now he would taketh. It happened after talking to one of my friends downtown actually. I went home and the sinking feeling just wouldn't go away so I started taking more of my doctor sanctioned speed in hopes of drowning it out but it didn't do any good.\n\n Normally I could escape any negative feeling with the speed but this time it was inescapable. One of our friends did some shit that started some drama, the friend group split, resulting in one of my friends that meant a lot to me leaving our entire group and I also left the group because I was pissed at them as well for making my other friend leave. This happened about three months after the sense of impending doom, so this was in June or July of 2021.\n\nI just took as much of my prescription as possible and knocked a hole in my wall out of despair. I was still living at home at the time (just recently moved out actually) and I remember telling my mother as I was in the throws of an amphetamine mediated mental breakdown \"I want to go home\" repeatedly even though I was literally in my own fucking room. \n\nLife has been sort of shit ever since then. \n\n&#x200B;",

Ironic though, because the previously mentioned irrational anger was over a disagreement, if you want to call it that, on gemstones(I told you it was silly). I also just recently started listening to vibrational meditation music as I sleep.   \nAnyways, in my dream I think I was watching a video on YouTube. In it, someone was going around a hippie-like festival having fun as a song played over the video, the music would pause or quiet down at moments where the person stopped to talk to someone. Near the end of the video, or at least before I woke up, there was a man talking and he said something along the lines of \"Love is not something you create/generate, it's an energy that always exists and you either feel in any moment or you don't.\" As I watched the video I cried. Soon after that I woke up and thought to myself \"man that was deep.\"  \n\n\nI don't really know what it means or why I dreamt that, but I found it very interesting and a kind of beautiful.   \n",

I\u2019m using a secondary reddit account right now just so no one I know can see this since it\u2019s kind of sensitive. \n\nBut the basic storyline is that since my partner and I met around a year ago, we both had insanely frequent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moments around the other person, like even multiple in one week. Not consecutively, of course. But they were very strong and we both made note of them at separate times, sometimes they would have the experience and I wouldn\u2019t or vice versa, or we would both experience it at the same time. \n\nWe broke up last night. We weren\u2019t fighting or anything, the breakup was completely amicable. It was entirely because of some emotional issues they were having in relation to me that just can\u2019t be fixed. We met up to see each other one final time, as a couple a least. \n\nDuring that, we had hugged and had been crying on each other and we both pulled away at the same time and noted we were both experiencing the same strong d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu we had always gotten. \n\nI\u2019m just heartbroken and trying to search for meaning in all of this, I think. But I would love to hear if anyone has a similar story or any ideas what this could mean for us or our future. We agreed to be friends, maybe in the closer to more distant future, whenever we can both feel a little better.",

I really didn\u2019t believe in meditation but one day at night  I started meditating than about 15 mins in I see a light reflecting on my eye lids and than I open my eyes, it was day time, I got up from the bed because I didn\u2019t believe that I was meditating for 8 hours, when I open my door to go downstairs the stairs were like in a spiral. I started to panic a little because I never seen my house like this everything was shifted or glitching through the walls, I call for help and no one answer my first thought was to run because I started feeling like someone was behind me and felt a really bad energy, when I came out of my house I saw a man with a sword, birds,rabbits, and in the sky it was a really bright light that blinded me every time I saw it, than I walked up to the guy and we started speaking in some other language that I don\u2019t know and I seem to know what we were saying, the man touch my forehead and I went through a vortex, when I came back to my room I had a really bad sleep paralysis long story short I come out of the sleep paralysis and I started to wonder what just happen and want it to know more so I meditated a second time.\n\nThe second time I was in my room, I saw a light in my eye lids again and open my eyes, this time  I see what I perceived  to be women/ even thought it look masculine with a green aura and she started speaking to me in the wierd language again but I do remember what she told me \u201cI will heal you\u201d touch my forehead and back to the vortex and into  another sleep paralysis, but this time I was able to move the first thought I had in my head was to hit the \u201csleep paralysis demon\u201d and when I hit it, it went to my closet when I was able to wake up, I found the door of my closet open and I went to check the outside camera and there wasn\u2019t no footage it was green at the time I was meditating\n\nSince than I had some weird  thoughts and believes that if I say it here people will call me crazy I even hide some things in this post that I saw and keeps happening to me",

Vectors have direction, like velocity or force; they imply movement in a certain direction.\n\nOn this forum, I've noticed a vast range of topics, from phenomena and feelings to beliefs and practices. Some of these topics are like scalars, while others are more like vectors.\n\nFor instance, I follow Sufism, which is very much a vector-oriented path. It has a clear end goal: a journey from the seen to the unseen, ultimately leading to God. Along this path, you encounter various aspects such as life, death, spirits, heavens, and more. However, none of these is the ultimate goal; God Himself is. All the other experiences are valuable by-products.\n\nBut on this forum, I sense that God isn't always the end goal, and that's perfectly fine. Sometimes, the objective is finding inner peace, explaining the unexplained, accepting oneself and the surroundings, exploring the inner psyche, discovering hidden universal energy, or achieving oneness with the universe.\n\nI'd love to learn more about your philosophy too. Maybe we can organize a conference one day, where each philosophy has its own booth. People seeking knowledge could stop by and explore these diverse perspectives.",

          "content": "A while ago, I got a reading from an intuitive I really trust, and my question was to receive spiritual knowledge from my guides. She told me she would convey something my guides wanted me to know at a high level\u2026 so it might resonate with some of you, it might not. But I felt called to share it here. Here\u2019s what she relayed: \n\n\n\ud83c\udf19 \n\n\n\n\u201cThe life you are living now is technically a memory... or will become a memory. You are not living this life right now, you are remembering this life right now. All the lives you have ever lived and all the lives you will ever live have happened simultaneously and you are simply intently focused on this one right here, right now.\n\nYou can bounce your consciousness to one of your other lives, but \"you\u201d, [insert name here], would not know you are doing that.  Only \"you,\" your higher self, would know you are doing that.  \n\nSo from the perspective of the [insert name here] character you are playing in this life, you will only be conscious of this one life.\n\nYour higher self, however, is conscious of all of them and can choose to zoom in or out of any of them.\n\nThe effect they want you to take from this is that you can recall wisdom that you learned in a past or future life and pull it into this life to help you make decisions, gain perspective, and not take life too seriously while at the same time having and creating the best life for yourself that you can.\n\nSo when life seems scary or you feel like it's not going the way you want, try to fly your consciousness level up into the sky and look down on this life as a blip, an important blip yes, but just a blip in eternity. Extract as much joy from it as you can. And try not to worry about anything.\u201d\n\n\n\u2728 \n\n\nHope this helps or enlightens any of you! :)",

I'm trying to get back into a practice, and I'm reading a book that has helped me tremendously in the past, \"Wisdom of No Escape\" by Pema Chodron, except this time, the whole practice of Maitri is completely lost on me. I find it very hard to feel compassionate or friendly, towards myself or towards others.\r  \n\r  \nA couple of weeks ago, my mom got into an accident, and hurt her foot which resulted in a bedrest. I did not have a strong reaction to this news. I am with her 24x7 and have no problems taking care of her, but I do not feel anything about it, positive or negative...\r  \n\r  \nThis aside, I have been finding people to be a chore more and more, and just could do with less interactions with them. The thing is, it's not exactly avoidance I feel when it comes to Maitri towards myself, it's more \"I'm neutral about whatever I'm feeling\". Where previously, I was working with intense emotions and getting to terms with them, now I feel like there's no emotions, or if there are emotions, I'm either not able to label them, or they are very subtle and maybe fly under the radar. Even right now, as I write this, I clearly feel sensations in my body, but I don't know what they are! And how do I develop compassion for something I don't even understand?\r  \nAnother thing that happened: yesterday at the movies I was getting some popcorn with a friend, and while talking to the cashier, apparently my tone must have gotten a bit intense since my friend told me to \"Calm down bro\", but, in that moment I did not feel angry, or at least feel anything that might have registered like anger.\r  \n\r  \nI think I am doing something wrong since I think I am regressing instead of learning more about myself and feeling compassionate towards people, and I don't know how to correct it.",

          "score": 3,
          "author": "2foxy4blvd",
          "content": "The Parallel Universe Theory and Spiritual Beings\n\nThe concept of parallel universes, also known as the multiverse theory, suggests that there are multiple universes that exist simultaneously alongside our own. These universes may have different physical laws, constants, and even different versions of ourselves. In this context, the idea that humans as spiritual beings are living multiple lives as different people concurrently is a philosophical and metaphysical interpretation of the parallel universe theory.\n\nConcurrent Lives and Spiritual Existence\n\nAccording to this interpretation, humans are not just physical beings living a singular life but are also spiritual entities experiencing multiple lives across different realities. Each individual\u2019s consciousness is not confined to a single existence but rather spans across various incarnations in different universes. These concurrent lives may involve different identities, experiences, and circumstances, all happening simultaneously.\n\nDreams as Glimpses into Other Lives\n\nThe notion that humans occasionally catch glimpses of their concurrent other lives in dreams aligns with the belief that the boundaries between these parallel existences can sometimes become blurred. In this view, dreams serve as windows into these alternate realities, offering fleeting glimpses of people, places, and events from other concurrent lives. These dreams may contain individuals whom the dreamer has never met in their present life and locations they have never visited, yet feel strangely familiar due to their connection to other concurrent existences.\n\nInterconnectedness of Spiritual Realms\n\nProponents of this interpretation often emphasize the interconnectedness of these spiritual realms and the influence they have on each other. They argue that experiences in one concurrent life can impact and resonate across other existences, leading to instances where individuals sense echoes or reflections of their other selves in dreams or moments of deep introspection.\n\nImplications for Personal Growth and Understanding\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, embracing the idea of concurrent lives as spiritual beings can lead to a deeper exploration of personal identity, empathy, and interconnectedness with others. It encourages individuals to consider the broader implications of their actions and experiences beyond the confines of a single lifetime, fostering a sense of unity with their other selves across different realities.\n\nIn summary, the concept that humans as spiritual beings are living multiple lives concurrently within parallel universes offers a unique perspective on the nature of existence and personal identity. It intertwines elements of metaphysics, spirituality, and interconnectedness while providing an intriguing framework for understanding the complexities of human consciousness.",

          "content": "\"The church that has the best chance of survival in this damned world is that of atheism under the convenient guise of theism. The churches have always proved the staunchest upholders of the grossest form of worldliness from which even the worst of non-ecclesiastical criminals are found to recoil.  \n\n\nIt is not from any deliberate opposition to the ordained clergy that these observations are made. The original purpose of the established churches of the world may not always be objectionable. But no stable religious arrangement for instructing the masses has yet been successful. The Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in pursuance of the teachings of the scriptures enjoins all absence of conventionalism for the teachers of the eternal religion. It does not follow that the mechanical adoption of the unconventional life by any person will make him a fit teacher of religion. Regulation is necessary for controlling the inherent worldliness of conditional souls.  \n\n\nBut no mechanical regulation has any value, even for such a purpose. The bona-fide teacher of religion is neither any product of nor the favourer of any mechanical system. In his hands no system has, likewise, the chance of degenerating into a lifeless arrangement. The mere pursuit of fixed doctrines and fixed liturgies cannot hold a person to the true spirit of doctrine or liturgy.  \nThe idea of an organized church in an intelligible form, indeed, marks the close of the living spiritual movement. The great ecclesiastical establishments are the dikes and the dams to retain the current that cannot be held by any such contrivances. They, indeed, indicate a desire on the part of the masses to exploit a spiritual movement for their own purpose. They also unmistakably indicate the end of the absolute and unconventional guidance of the bona-fide spiritual teacher. The people of this world understand preventive systems, they have no idea at all of the un-prevented positive eternal life. Neither can there be any earthy contrivance for the permanent preservation of the life eternal on this mundane plane on the popular scale.\"  \n*P\u016btan\u0101 - by \u015ar\u012bla Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura Prabhup\u0101da*",

When I woke up, I made full notes of my dream which are below. Her name has been changed out of respect for privacy.\n\n-Dreamt Emily died\n\n-that she died by su**cide, but I knew that it was framed to look like that. I suspect her husband \n\n- I was at house for some reason, her husband never physically there in dream but I kept hearing him incoherently and I knew he was being a dick even though he never said anything that make sense it was all mumbled \n\nwhen I was in house, her husband was in the back doing something. I used this time to look for clues. On the side of the house was a motion light like I have, so could see if he went  past so I could avoid getting caught. His phone was charging by front door, I had to unplug his phone as well as cable in way of door, and put door on latch (same as my door) but not fully lock it so I could quickly unlock before he noticed  \n\n- I looked in mirror and asked what you wanted me to do, and what she wanted me to do that's best for her baby  I screamed in mirror crying \n\n-people selling stuff on street idk what though, I told them you'd love it (think it was shoes), and then I cried because she spoke about you like you were alive as I didn't tell her you died. She call the company on that store, and they agrees I could have good from the store because of your death\n\n- I think I woke up in my dream while still dreaming, because last thing that happened was I asked my other 2 friends if Emily really died, and they said no and were all confused\n\n- at the end, some weird creature that looked like logs of a tree killed them. It k*lled them both and I woke up in real life then",

I was not sure about making this soul tie with him as he has had some interesting and scary spiritual experiences and I know there are spirits that linger around him (They are generally repelled by my energy). So after I come home from college , my grandmother says she can feel the soul tie and starts praying for me the entire day. Two other people in my family said they\u2019ve cried for me. & My aunt said that she felt unsettled when looking at me and everyone was essentially hinting that my soul was in some kind of turmoil, which is off because they\u2019ve only said this a few days ago & i\u2019ve had this soultie for  months. I\u2019ve been around my family and they haven\u2019t said anything like this before. They are christian and essentially told me i was living in sin and the whole talk of shit i already knew. Essentially the entire family was talking about me being sexually active and how i\u2019m not doing well in my soul . The thing is my soul has always been in turmoil I guess you can say. I\u2019ve struggled with religion from a very young age & they\u2019ve seen that barely and all of sudden when I have a soultie they can feel it ?? I have been in the same turmoil since 12, now there\u2019s just a soul tie on top. I am not christian and I am more spiritualist. I\u2019m not sure what may have changed and my family is pretty spiritually  accurate but christian\u2019s can be cultish sometimes and my family has done very horrible things in the name of christianity.

Additionally I believe in a plant based diet for many reasons, and morals being one, however she is not. For the longest I\u2019ve tried to tell myself these are small things, but as I\u2019ve carried on through my journey they have grown in significance greatly, and the differences are harder to ignore especially being that I don\u2019t really have anyone else to talk to about these things- we used to have open minded conversations all the time, now every subject is sensitive or frustratingly hard to explain. And now, we\u2019ve welcomed a child into this work\u2026 and with that, our differences in how we want to raise our child are exposing the tension we\u2019ve held back for so long. \n\nThe things we used to ignore, on an \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d kind if scale, are issues we can\u2019t move past and instead of talking it out, we just stop talking because we\u2019d rather not clash\u2026 but how long will this last?? She\u2019s my first love, we\u2019ve been through a lot and have grown so much together, and I see so much for us\u2026 but am I delusional? I don\u2019t know\u2026 I know our differences are amplified for me at least because I already feel alone enough, I don\u2019t have any friends of my own to chat with on a daily basis, definitely none to have deep talks and connections with, none with beliefs even close. I do value having different views, I see it as helping expanding my horizons and proving different perspectives\u2026 but can a healthy relationship grow from views that clash so hard? \n\nWith that being said, I\u2019m open to making new friends and chatting more\u2026 I know there aren\u2019t too many specific details, I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m trashing her and also don\u2019t want to speak so much negativity out into existence, so I\u2019ll leave it at that. All I know is, I feel like I\u2019m in a losing battle more than ever, in between just trying to keep the peace and pushing my own values to the side, and fully diving into my journey and standing on my beliefs even if it makes me the bad guy in the eyes of those I know, based on nothing other than being different. I\u2019m cordial with everyone and everyone is pretty accepting of who they think I am, but I don\u2019t open up too much because I\u2019m already kind of a black sheep, but I truly don\u2019t want to be that lonely, ya know.

          "content": "Disclaimer: I know this is like a dirty word after those documentaries came out, but I do have a divine counterpart (twin flame) and if you don\u2019t believe in them, that\u2019s cool, but this post isn\u2019t for you. \n\nOkay, I have never met anyone else who identifies with the specifics of my journey, but I\u2019m praying SOMEONE here will. Pls I would like to know if you\u2019ve experienced anything similar.\n\nBasically, I feel that my person and I have shared work to do. \n \nFor context, I had an awakening (by way of a karmic catalyst) that began in 2018. And culminated in a kind of ego death experience in   2020. My twin had what he calls a Kundalini awakening, I believe in 2015. And went on to follow a yogic path. We didn\u2019t meet until summer 2020 through his work as a yoga teacher and mentor. \n\nI was meeting with him as a client initially but things quickly got muddy. Anyway, in our last meeting together he said himself that he could tell I was meant to do the same work as him. \n\nLater in my journey, after we were separated and were no longer speaking, I got downloads about our shared business/brand. I built our brand guidelines, a social media strategy, and email copy for a brand launch in a span of days. It was an insane creative wave. And it felt SO exciting. Like it was exactly what I\u2019m meant to do. \n\nBut of course, we weren\u2019t in contact, and as much as I wanted it then, I eventually understood there were likely still things to be cleared/learned/resolved on either side.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s been 2 years, now, officially, since we last spoke. While I do think I have seen evidence of healing in him and certainly know I\u2019ve felt it in me, he\u2019s still not here.\n\nBut meanwhile, I have been guided towards learning new things (getting a yoga certification, which I didn\u2019t even intend to do), learning astrology, yoga and other tools and modalities, lenses through which we analyze our souls evolution. \n\nI\u2019ve also been healing and transforming so no time is wasted. \n\nBut No other job/career development opportunity has shown up for me, and it\u2019s not for lack of me putting out applications. \n\nI\u2019ve worked part time as a barista at the top of this year for a few months, but beyond that I haven\u2019t worked a job since the top of 2021. \n\nNow I\u2019ve been provided for, in truly exceptional ways, ways I never could have imagined for myself. But I have had financial struggles along the way. And just a lack of stability. \n\nI\u2019ve been growing, no doubt about it, learning lessons about scarcity/abundance, about trusting my intuition, about so much more on my spiritual journey so far. I\u2019ve also been (and there\u2019s no better way to say this) waiting. \n\nNow I know all this rhetoric about loving yourself, serving yourself, focusing on yourself. Trust me when I say, this is a lesson I\u2019ve already learned. I am not gripping onto him or an idea of who he is so that he can come fill me up. I am whole. And I don\u2019t even need him as a romantic partner. \n\nBut this work\u2026.it feels like what I\u2019m made for. Specifically WITH him. I have tried to outrun it, to commit to other jobs, to tell myself I\u2019m crazy. Nothing works. \n\nThis work feels imperative and inevitable. I just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s meant to come to fruition, and not having other opportunities in the meantime is challenging. I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nSo I said all this to ask if anyone else feels they share a mission with their twin and can\u2019t move on with their purposeful work alone.",

          "content": "My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over two years. We're both female, and she's a bit older than me, for context. We live together and I feel like she is the only person I can trust and connect with. I have family and friends, and have had previous relationships, but she is the only person who has (and ever has had) access to the deepest parts of me. I have struggled with depression since I was 9 (I'm 21 now), and was suicidal during the first year of our relationship, due to circumstances that had nothing to do with her. It got to the point where she saw me suffering so much that she respected my choice to die, if I were to make it. I had been looking into psilocybin for years, and decided to try it, since I felt I had nothing to lose. My girlfriend was with me the whole time, and supported me during my very spiritually charged trip. It was my last resort for my depression, and it worked. I won't say I never feel sad or upset, but years of suicidal ideation and severe, debilitating depression melted away. It had its setbacks, but that's not was this post is about. Because of the psilocybin, I was finally able to get a job and be financially independent. I finally felt joy, and had a bit of a spiritual awakening after the shrooms wore off. I felt inclined to make changes in my life to help me become more spiritually concious, but I eventually fell into old habits. I'm not depressed or suicidal, but I feel stuck in my unhealthy ways and consumed by my ego self. \n\nThe psilocybin trip was one year ago, almost exactly. Recently, I felt myself awakening again. Everything around me started going wrong. My health started failing, I ended up in the emergency room twice in less than 4 days, and money has become very tight. Random appliances need expensive repairs (most need to be replaced) and the tires in my car keep popping. I cannot afford any repairs, so I have a family member doing my laundry for me and I need to shower out of a bucket (my water heater burst). Out of nowhere, my father (who I had a normal relationship with up to this point) decided to sue me, due to matters relating to my mother's death. I've become very stressed and paranoid, can barely sleep, and my relationship has been affected significantly by our financial struggles and my emotional state. My girlfriend implied that I may be cursed, but I disagree. It is my belief that the universe is all but forcing me to wake up and make the changes necessary to become the spiritual version of myself I want to be. I was in peace with all this chaos, until it started affecting my relationship.\n\nMy girlfriend is very open minded, but spiritual talk scares her. For her, it's all about darkness, ghosts, and negative energy. She and I can have enlightening conversations about my general beliefs regarding conciousness, the universe, the soul, etc., but the second things get a little \"dark\" (astral projection, lucid dreaming, messages from spirits, seeing shadows from the corners of my eyes, eerie coincidences), she checks out. In these cases, she automatically assumes it's all in my head and I may need psychological help. I think it's her fear of the unknown, of the non material world, and of things she doesn't understand. I don't blame her, but I desperately feel the need to be supported on this journey, and I feel like she cannot provide that. I feel like my ego self wants the validation, wants to feel seen and heard, and this is the only way it knows how to, since she is the only person who really knows me. But I also know this is a lot of pressure to put on a person, and I will not expect her to engage in conversations or explore beliefs that she does not feel comfortable exploring. \n\nSpirituality has become such an important part of my life during these past 2 months, probably because it offered peace during the absolute chaos around me. Now I feel like my relationship is crumbling because I don't feel supported, and I seem to lack the ability to connect to others enough to have these types of conversations. I understand that this is a me issue and an ego issue, but I also think it is valid and human nature to want support. I understand that it's not valid to expect one person to provide that support when she does not want to.\n\nMy girlfriend is currently extremely anxious because I mentioned that I've felt very connected to the spirit world lately. She developed an intense fear of the dark. I didn't think providing general info on my spiritual awakening was a scary subject (I know now), but now she's thinking about ghost tales and the house being haunted. I don't want to make her seem childish, but sometimes it feels like the open minded person I came to love is now paralyzed in fear. She also has no interest in awakening, and I have no interest in forcing her to. I worry about her mental state being affected by my spiritual awakening, since there will be changes in my behavior with my spiritual transformation, even if I don't mention them. \n\nI'm not willing to break it off, but we are fighting more than ever (ugly fights about things that are very important to me but she sees as little things, nothing physical) and I feel lost. What do I do? How can I find people who are willing to have these conversations with me, so I don't burden my partner? How do I go through this process without giving my gf an anxiety disorder? Does anyone have a partner who sees spirituality as an absolute no? I'm open to criticism as well.",

The first couple times, I didn't think much of it because I often have very vivid dreams about people I know, and many times they don't really make much sense.  But this particular person kept reappearing (probably like 4 or 5 times). And the last few times, the dreams were \"more than friendly.\" In the last two dreams, we were cuddled up very close in a cozy embrace. It felt very romantic, but I don't think I feel that way about him.  I feel like I see him like a brother or something in real life.\nSo my question is...should I be concerned that I am developing feelings for this person or just not really think too far into it? I often have a habit of praying for him whenever I think of him...just to make sure he's ok. Does that have something to do with these dreams? Is that creating a fondness that might be contributing to deeper emotions like love? \nAll answers are welcome, but I am particularly eager to hear from people who have spiritual and metaphysical insight.\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff",

          "content": "I loved to watch Bob Ross take the stage and paint a new picture in every episode. It was a captivating experience, and one particular episode left an indelible mark.\n\nBob started a new painting by putting a layer of color onto the canvas, a bold blue that nearly covered all of the space. I was baffled; it seemed as if he had carelessly destroyed his canvas, leaving no room for anything else. What in the world is he doing? I thought. But in reality, he possessed a vision beyond my grasp.\n\nWith every stroke, he defied my expectations. Layer upon layer, he mixed colors and breathed life into the canvas. From that same bold blue backdrop emerged majestic mountains, delicate trees, charming houses, graceful birds, and lush bushes. It was a symphony of colors and shapes, a masterpiece of depth and intricacy that far surpassed my fifth-grade doodles. Bob Ross was a true master of his craft.\n\nWhen Hindus seek to connect with their deities, they turn to a piece of stone. With unwavering devotion, they chip away, hammering and whittling, until the stone takes on a sacred form. Through every resounding blow, it finds its shape and purpose.\n\nRemarkably, the stone never objects to the relentless punishment; it simply endures blow after blow. Once the features are meticulously carved, the idol is bathed in milk and revered as a deity, a source of spiritual connection and guidance.\n\nIn much the same way, our own life experiences shape our character. The first encounters may appear as random strokes on the canvas of our existence, leaving us confused. But as time unfolds, each experience contributes to the grand design.\n\nFrom those seemingly haphazard layers of colors emerge the distinct shapes of our personalities. The challenges we face, akin to the strikes on the sculptor's stone, chisel away to reveal our unique features. It's through unanswered questions and unforeseen hurdles that a clear, profound picture emerges.\n\nTime, always moving forward, assumes the role of an artist. We, the living beings, are its canvas, and our experiences, like brushstrokes and strikes, bring forth the masterpiece of our lives. It's a reminder that we, too, are sculpted by time's hand, evolving into the remarkable works of art that we are destined to become.\n\nTime is an artist, and we are its art.",

You can say I\u2019m lacking in faith and trust. \n\nI think what\u2019s caused this is doing TOO much searching/reading (astral projection, quantum physics, metaphysics, non duality, etc) that I\u2019ve lost sense of the basics - be aware, be a good person. \n\nI notice that i\u2019m also salty that I hear many people having spiritual experiences (obe\u2019s/nde\u2019s *not that brushing with death is a good thing!!*, life reviews, spirit contacts), and I wonder why not me (although I did induce astral projection once briefly but haven\u2019t been able to again). I also notice the irony of seeking so hard, being so ego and thought led that makes having these experiences difficult. \n\nIt feels like there\u2019s a secret out there that i\u2019m not allowed to know.\n\nI guess i\u2019m just looking to see if anyone has advice, or can share their perspective on these topics or has struggled with something like this before.\n\nThank you!",

However, there was a Chinese container on my bed head and I moved it a little and I heard noise in it which I assumed were bugs but it was kinda loud like there were so much in there it was taking over my ears and my thought was \u201cget gloves and get rid of it\u201d. Another small thing that happened was my music was playing fading out in the backround and the person seemed to like it and was like what was that? But I was focused on trying to get the mess out I didn\u2019t even wanna talk to them. After waking up for one I thought about who was in the dream and now I\u2019m wondering what could be the meaning behind me cleaning my room or it being messy as if there is something I am not seeing. I wonder if there is something I must do like cleanse my space or what. I also hope if the person was actually in my dream he didn\u2019t think I was dirty af lmaoooo omg. I did research but I\u2019m not getting much so what do you think?",

We did get her for $50 at a garage sale, so we always joked about how she was a great find. She was super funny and outgoing, she would sleep with me every night, I would take her on car rides and she was my animal soulmate. I live 5 hours away from my hometown and my mom had let me know a few months earlier that JoJo wasn\u2019t doing well and that she just wanted me to be aware. I got a text from my mom and I knew it was about my dog. She was telling me that JoJo had been pooping and throwing up blood, sleeping a lot and not eating so I knew it wasn\u2019t good. I took off work on Saturday and drove home to spend her last moments with her. I kept thinking about how she spent the last night with me in my bed the night before I left for college and I wanted to spend the last day with her before she passed. We gave her a spa day, she got some Turkey and potato chips (she loves chips) and some chocolate. I was there when we put her down, I held her on the way home from the vet and then we buried her. After that, I was seeing a lot of Angel numbers, specifically 111 and 222, and was seeing flocks of birds everywhere, but last night I was watching \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d with Leonardo DiCaprio, and I\u2019ve seen this movie a few times but forgot about this one scene. The night before I was talking to her in my mind, telling her that she was such a good dog and that I wish things would\u2019ve been different, and asked if she was giving me those signs from the other side. I told her to keep sending me signs to let me know she was okay and happy. This scene in Don\u2019t Look Up shocked me. Leonardo is talking about how he was really sad because their families dog JoJo had to be put down last year and I was just shocked. Where do animals go? Can animals send us signs?

          "author": "Original-Isopod731",
          "content": "Ho'oponopono is a traditional Hawaiian healing practice that uses a simple mantra to release negative emotions, thoughts, and experiences.\n\nThis ancient spiritual tradition honors the Hawaiian belief about the interconnectedness of all things and the power of thoughts and words to shape reality. At its core, Ho'oponopono is the practice of forgiveness and reconciliation as a means to improve one's relationships with others and the wider world.\n\nHo'oponopono, an oral tradition that has been passed down through the ages, is still an essential aspect of Hawaiian culture; it involves accepting \"total responsibility,\" asking for forgiveness, and owning up to one's mistakes as part of a strong group effort to effect positive change.   \n\nIn fact, ho'oponopono teaches us that our thoughts and deeds affect other people. It also teaches us that compassion and empathy are necessary for true healing on a personal and global level. After all, we are all connected, and what affects one, affects the whole.  \n\nWHAT IS HO'OPONOPONO PRAYER ?? \n\nHo'oponopono, which means \"to right a wrong,\" is a short phrase that is spoken repeatedly to bring balance and peace back to areas where they have been lost.\n\nIt is very easy to use the ho'oponopono prayer for ancestral healing, relationship conflicts, and community healing. Some people even use it as a daily meditation or mindfulness practice, repeating the prayer on a regular basis to keep a positive outlook, elevate their energetic vibration, and release any negativity that may have built up over time. Here it is:\n\n**\"I'm sorry, please forgive me, thank you, I love you.\"**\n\nTHE MEANING OF HO'OPONOPONO ?\n\nBefore beginning the Ho'oponopono prayer, clear your mind of any distractions and unfavorable ideas. Then, concentrate only on the words you are speaking and the present moment. \n\nIn order to send healing vibrations to someone you are praying for, it is vital to keep your attention on them. You do not have to know the person or people you are praying for personally.\n\nNow, let's break down what Ho'oponopono means:\n\n\\- Saying \"I am sorry\" is simply a way to acknowledge that wrong was done. This is because we are all one, and what affects one, affects the other. That being said, saying \"I am sorry\" is an important tool in cultivating humility and grace. The ho'oponopono prayer begins with this statement: \"You are responsible for anything that has ever happened to you, or anything wrong that you have witnessed.\"\n\n\\- This is the Ho'oponopono repentance step, \"Please forgive me.\" In this step, you ask for forgiveness for whatever wrong you are trying to right, even if you were not directly responsible for it. It defuses negativity, reminds you that everyone is equal, and promotes healing for all.\n\n\\- Saying 'Thank You : Expressing appreciation is a key part of the Ho'oponopono practice. Healing and positive life changes can result from cultivating an optimistic and appreciative mental state.\n\n\\- I love you: Saying \"I love you\" is a powerful technique to bring about forgiveness, as well as a way to release bad ideas and emotions, as well as a way to promote inner peace and harmony. It is a declaration of love and acceptance addressed towards oneself, others, and the cosmos. The concept of \"I love you\" in Ho'oponopono is to develop self-love and to recognize that everything and everyone is a part of the same universal consciousness. You can start the process of healing and transformation in your relationships with other people and in yourself by expressing love and compassion.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, unless you let go, unless you forgive yourself, unless you forgive the situation, unless you realize that the situation is over, you cannot move forward.\u201d \u2013 Steve Maraboli\n\nI often repeat the healing prayer while looking in the mirror while working out on the treadmill, and this is a great way to fully integrate the Ho'oponopono prayer for healing into your daily routine.\n\nYou can grab [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s_dgmikZTX7-BSQH4rEvOzFihFrLCx6i/view?usp=sharing) as in .pdf so you can have it in your phone and pray anytime and anywhere you want.\n\nThanks me later !

          "score": 4,
          "author": "magickman_1",
          "content": "Hello to everyone, I've been going through some very rough obstacles and turmoil in my life in recent years and I feel like I've been tested and beaten down absolutely to my breaking point. I've simply felt barely alive (metaphorically speaking) for quite some time now. I'd like to know what a process like this could be about, are there any underlying reasons for someone going through something like this or have these events just been random coincidences?\n\nIn a way you could say that this process has been going on for 12-13 years, since during my high school years I started to feel quite detached from the people around me and this is when the period of my loneliness started. Ever since then I haven't really been able to meet people that I could resonate with or vice versa and have been desperately trying to search for my place in this world with the right people around me. But anyways, in the beginning this loneliness was quite hard to take and caused me to be very depressed and anxious. Later on, I've gotten used to it.\n\nThe major traumatic events in my life have been going on for around 7-8 years now. It all started with me developing a sort of infection cycle that caused me to be sick pretty much all the time for around 2-3 years. Every time I'd gotten better from the last virus/flu I'd very soon be hit with something new again and I was also feeling very weak and powerless otherwise. It took a long time to understand what the reasons behind this were and also the medical system couldn't help me in any way. This process was due to me pushing myself over my limits and burning out and me being a vegetarian/vegan for around five years. The vegetarian/vegan diet simply didn't work for me, and I developed severe deficiencies that caused my health to crash. At the lowest point of this phase I felt so weak that walking 1km was exhausting...\n\nEventually I started to understand the reasons for my ill health and did everything I possibly could to get my health back and bounce back from this. When I started to feel better and had worked tremendously to achieve it my dad got diagnosed with cancer. He still lived for a year, but I had to basically watch him slowly fade away, go through many surgeries and battle mentally with being in this situation and try to support him. Before he died there wasn't much left of this man.\n\nAfter his death I had to take care of my father\u2019s farm in the countryside that he'd been living on. My dad lived off of cultivating farmland, but he didn't have any animals or anything like that. He was also a bit of a hoarder and had huge amounts of junk and machinery all around the farm. Nothing was in order and also otherwise inheriting his land and the farm was a completely new situation for me since I lived in the city with my mom and had never had any interest in these things. Somehow, I survived this process even after everything I'd gone through and luckily, I got some help from other people whereas others made everything as difficult as they could. Luckily, after this I didn't have to live poorly as a student anymore.\n\nAfter things started to seem better with the inheritance and my health, I felt like I was in the best shape of my entire life both mentally and physically. I was very eager to finally start my life. I got admitted to a new master's programme that I was very excited about, since this would mean that I'd be able to have the chance to make new friends and live the life of a normal young man. This hope and excitement didn\u2019t last long, since very soon after this covid started, and I realized that this new chance would never come to fulfillment, since in my country they kept all the universities closed during this whole period. The disappointment was insane, because I realized that the process of me being almost in complete isolation would still go on, and during that time no one knew how long it would last. This was mentally extremely hard to take.\n\nAfter the covid restrictions were removed, I obviously thought that now I'll finally be able to start building my life. A few weeks passed with life being normal and after a basketball game of mine I went to the grocery store and got some kind of seizure that caused me to faint and get cramps all over my body. Still to this day no one knows what it was about. Didn't have epilepsy or anything like that. Anyways, this seizure caused me to fall down on the floor. I hit my head so hard on the floor that I fractured my skull, which caused bleeding in the meninges in my skull, which required surgery. I was taken to the hospital, they cut my skull open so that they could stop the bleeding and that there wouldn't be any pressure on my brain that could cause severe brain damage. They were successful, but despite this I got a moderate brain Injury from the hit on my head on another part of my brain. This sounds weird but I'm 198cm/6'6 tall so that's why the hit was so hard.\n\nThis has been the lowest point of my life, I've recovered well from the brain injury and the long-lasting damage of it has been quite minor, but mentally I've been in ruins. A very traumatic experience and obviously you'll wonder what you are good for in this life anymore, since you have a been injured in such devastating a way. The surgery also left me with and ugly large scar on my head, seven plates of titanium on my skull that are sticking out (luckily I have very thick hair) and a slightly disfigured skull. My intelligence and my looks were the last things I was proud of myself despite things not having gone my way otherwise in this life, so I felt like I've been stripped off of everything I had.   \n\n\nSo what can be the spiritual explanations of someone going through this much trauma in their life without getting a break? How can I find hope in this life again and find joy and happiness again? Especially understanding that these things weren't meaningless and that I still serve some kind of purpose in this world would help me with going on and pushing through despite these obstacles.\n\nAll answers and insights will be highly appreciated!",

Therefore, after success happiness disappears. It seems to appear a pleasure but soon is gone. The truth is success doesn't create happiness. But happiness by itself is success. We have to overcome the myth and that we believe that if we are successful, we will be happy. In fact, if the other way around if we are happy, we will be successful. After we are successful, are we content, are we satisfied? No. Our need becomes a greed. Our desires and passions overtake us and there is stress and anxiety. So, we are never happy.",

I've sometimes felt strong emotions while meditating (both visualizing and without visualization). Being a 32 yo male, I find it hard to tell about my feelings and the way I emotionally react to certain life situations to my friends. They just say I overthink.\n\nI'm sure being a highly sensitive person (hsp) has it's strenghs and advantages, but I'm not aware of these, so I just look at the negatives and can't find a way of strengthening my self-esteem. So I came here for suggestions. How do you channel your sensitivity through your life? Any hobbies that make this part of you spark? Should I focus more of my time on seeking union with the Divine instead of doing so with people? I crave more connection, but I can't get this type of connection from the people I'm surrounded with. Could it be that HSP are more spiritually inclined and that we should strongly cultivate our mystical side to function properly so we have something to channel our strong emotions to?\n\nEdit: sensible to sensitive",

Im not very good at expressing myself or words. Also sorry if you misinterpret my post by the title or anything in the post itself. Im really trying here.

If this isn't the only place I should ask or another place that might help me plz point me In the right direction\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4fanybody else ever experienced this and/or have any advice or info that'll help sort this out or anything that I could use to help cope and end these attacks and protect myself and others. Also any info or advice on supporting other people that are going through the same thing/similar experience/s.\n\nIll start with telepathy. I'm not new to telepathy(not the greatest or very good at it) but I do need all the advice n help I can get surrounding anything to do with it(especially the attacks and harassment or torture from other people with evil intentions wanting to cause harm to others)I've dealt with negative and positive experiences, some negative experiences screwed me up abit but I'm trying to heal and work on myself and ive come along way(still not the best and always trying to learn and grow)some positive have guided me, taught me alot and helped me. but now i need to reach out to all possible places I can for help with this or anything I should know and learn regarding the darkside of spirituality. Need as much info and advice as possible please\n\nThe issue that I need urgent help with now is losing control of myself/not staying connected to myself completely/not being able to connect with people that can help me when i need help and someone with evil intentions trying to cause harm is able to somehow hijack me, my whole body, my mind and like take over to a degree it's a struggle to fight to stay connected to myself and stay in control of myself and be me and my true self in these situations. I'm worried that with the evil people trying to cause harm being in control of someone they could walk someone off a bridge, stop them from breathing or stop their heart from beating or anything like that. Which I feel like I should add are all real experiences. But could these evil people be able to remotely take another's life? Like what are we dealing with here cos it's abit of a worry",

I got the job very specific to my manifestations (the location, the initial experience, the interviews). Almost everything I wrote and desired had came true. It felt so good that I had been granted that opportunity and manifestation WORKS. I manifested the exact week the applications would open. At this time I felt more content with my life and how it was going. \n\nHOWEVER.\n\nThat job was a mistake. A very big mistake in my opinion. The only good it served was to make me let go of the desire for working there. I thought it would ensure my happiness but it did the opposite. Things weren\u2019t necessarily bad or toxic, they just felt very wrong and unsuitable to me.   \nI missed out on spending time in the summer with my animals due to the workload. Now two of them have passed and I will never get that time back. I gained a new habit of insomnia, which still affects me 4 months later. Extra stress. \n\nI quit the job after a month. \n\nSo, my manifestation worked, but the universe was clearly telling me that it was not for me. Now I am reluctant to manifest anything else. I wonder if it was some sort of backfire for thinking I could change my reality myself rather than praying. I tried really hard for that job and can\u2019t help but feel like I sabotaged myself for getting it. \n\n&#x200B;",

          "content": "This will be a very long post with many layers to it, so bear with me.\n\nWhen I was a child, I had this irrational fear of death. A toddler thinking about death is weird and was probably not something my parents knew how to deal with. They did their best, but what can you do, you know? Anyways, when I was a kid, I would have this reoccurring night terror that I died on a Victorian train cause the tunnel was collapsing. That dream would mess with me because even after I had woken up, I would feel bigger than I was like my blanket felt small. My heart would be pounding, and I didn't feel real. Sometimes, my Mom would come in to comfort me, telling me later that it was like I was looking through her, not at her. I don't remember seeing her coming in to comfort me; I only remember her voice, like I was blind. I would have that night terror for years until I was probably 8 or 9 when my Dad woke me up in the middle of it, and it never came back after that. There was also one time I swear to god I saw, which this will sound stupid, but I saw glowing neon skeletons pulling themselves out of my wall. I wasn't dreaming I woke up to that. I've also had genuine, very frequent Deja Vu like I had a dream about my 7th-grade Global Issues class in 4th grade. Everything was exactly as it was in the dream, excluding one or two kids being different. \n\nMy fear of death went away throughout middle school and high school until senior year when it was brought back to me by my friend talking about how she died and came back. The fear kicked up with frequent anxiety attacks and stuff. Nothing major, though, cause I was dealing with other issues that masked that issue, I guess. A year of therapy, exploring spirituality/religion, and surviving an abusive guy later. Now, I am at this moment where I have nothing to worry about, but death cause everything is going well for me. Here's the problem, though: I don't fear death so I don't know what is actually going on. I have a therapist, and I take medicine for my ADHD, but I have no other apparent neurological issues as far as I know. You might now be wondering what this has to do with negative spirits; I did a thing.\n\nSo, one night in my senior year, I got bored and openly invited ghosts into my mind. That sounds ridiculous and strange now that I typed it out, but I did that. I had this vivid dream of arguing with a woman in a household, and then I was in a low-angle POV going down a hospital hallway, almost like I was lying in a bed. Then I felt something lying next to me that wouldn't let go of me, so I had to kick it and punch it away. Nothing happened again after that. \n\nRecently, the fear of death or I should say the dread feeling, is getting stronger. I am working with my therapist to work through it. Reddit wasn't my first pick, lol. I know nothing about the spiritual realm or what's cooking there. Maybe anyone who knows about it could shed insight into all of that. I'll answer questions people ask me or any insights, which could be medical ones. For now, though, I will say that I know to keep working with my therapist. I don't need anyone telling me that. I had a response saying that once, and I was like cool, I already know that. I'm looking more toward the spiritual side of things, but again, if anyone knows psychology, that would be cool.\n\n&#x200B;",

It felt like it was in a big sports auditorium, an arena and I was watching a game (no idea what games) with a bunch of people. It was like a stadium. Every scheduled time, we rotate. \n\nThen I made some friends who I would watch the games with together. And then rotate out, like in a conference,  to catch specific events. It was so nice to meet up later after our specific events.\n\nI then recall, it seemed I was playing different roles and then get out of it (events). I had this one close friend where we would run  around together to catch our 'events'. \nA specific conversation is what I recalled and I haven't stop thinking about it.\n\nRemember the roles you have to play per event, It looked like we keep racing to catch our events/rooms. One time, my friend stops me to say 'This is you' -it was a person. He found my event for me. I asked 'how do you know? How do I know how to find 'me'? Then he describes what to look for, but I can't remember what it was.\n\nAfter that, he asked, 'Do you understand what we are doing now?' . I respond with so much conviction by saying 'oh yes, this is about past lives and we go around multiple times to learn....' I can't remember what I said after that.\n\nThe strange thing is, the moment I said that, the scene scrambled up and I became scared. It turned into darkness and when I could see again, I was no longer at that arena and me and my buddy were sea horses.\n\nPS: No psychedelics were consumed prior to dream. Also, I just went through a major surgery a week ago and recovering. Oxy?",

We contacted more through summer. She was travelling a lot for college so I think he contacted me as he was just bored.\n\nOn Friday  I asked was he seeing anyone.\nHe ignored my message. Instead, he decided to post images of them together on Instagram. Ouch.\nI saw they both posted pics on their Instagram on Sunday from the time he went up to see her. They definitely appear to be a couple as he is about to kiss her in one photo. \n\n I blocked him as I couldn't let him toy with me. We had an on/off online friendship since 2020. I never thought I'd develop feelings but I did this year. \n \n\n\nI don't know if I'm a believer in karma cos it seems too many people get away with being crappy individuals. (If you have seen karma happen please let me know!!)\n\nPart of me wants to text him and just tell him everything that completely let it go. But I wonder is it worth it.",

Numbers are road maps.\r  \n\n\nEveryone can write words, so what makes certain alignments of them create emotion and reflection? It\u2019s all the intention my dear friends. The tone we adopt, the purpose of our actions is not always seen, but is always tasted. So I taste like lemon and smell like skunk.\r  \nSo be free to express all that you are, as you please. If they accept the idea that you are too much, retort in a way that is once again unique to you. Fight with your own swords that you have forged for yourself. We fight if we feel injustice, because we are defending humanity. We work for humans, and we are with humans. There are us and there are the others, those who tarnish us, because that is their way of being and doing. Let\u2019s say they feed on that, so as not to be vulgar. So, what is left for us to do except to be totally sovereign and free. I'm talking here about who comes to mind, what influences us, what wants more for us than we want for ourselves, in a sense that is not constantly positive. If there was no enemy, we would not be the hero of our film. And because we must be centric, these visible and invisible enemies will do everything to keep us in a weak, heavy and low-vibration state. Don't believe in hazard. This word doesn't even exist. It came from itself. It is meaningless and makes no sense. Synchronicity on the other hand is anything that makes sense. We receive this as a message to us and it is. Even if the mind creates meaning, there is also meaning in that, and therefore, the laws that govern us cannot reject what is there for us at the moment we experience it.\r  \n\n\nSo I got to 330 words before realizing that I had far exceeded 100 words.

          "content": "This might not be the best place to post this as it is drug related but I consider myself a person with spiritual beliefs and I want to see if you guys have had similar experiences, so I feel that I\u2019m not alone. \n\nI haven\u2019t been feeling so great lately. In August of 2022 I went to kayak at the lake with a friend and drop a tab of acid. The acid kicked in way later than normal, by the time it hit it got dark and we were already done kayaking. So we were just sitting at the pier waiting for the acid to wear off so we could get back home. This friend was probably not the best guy to trip with because he\u2019s kind of reckless and untrustworthy, so I started getting really paranoid. The pitch black darkness of the night made it way worse, I felt like I entered the eternal void and the universe was just full of meaninglessness. I started having derealization and feeling like nothing is real, then I had a panic attack. Overall the trip was really bad but by the time I got home and started coming down I had the most insane visuals of my life while staring at the bathroom tiles. It was the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Because of that I know that it was acid and not nbome.\n\nAnyways after that trip it kinda of traumatized me even though it ended on a good note. That sense of void and meaninglessness continued, I kept feeling anxious, and derealization persisted. I felt like nothing was real and it was all an illusion. I believe I developed HPPD because I would look at my bathroom tiles and see them slowly shifting, I believe they call it visual snow. These feeling continued for a few months and by January of 2023 it got a lot better. Pretty much all the symptoms were gone besides the visual snow. I felt good again.\n\nFast forward to summer of 2023 I started smoking weed again, and everytime I smoked I\u2019d get anxious, paranoid, derealized all over again. A couple times I had really bad panic attacks where I genuinely felt like I was dying. It felt like a full on LSD trip when I smoked weed. The visual snow would intensify also. One time I got so high I had really scary auditory hallucinations and I think I went into a short period of psychosis.\n\nI decided to quit weed again because of that and now I\u2019m 49 days clean. Although I still have all the symptoms from my first bad acid trip a year prior. Everyday I wake up anxious, I have this bad feeling in my chest all day long. The worst thing right now is the depersonalization/derealization, it\u2019s slowly getting better but I have to distract myself so I\u2019m not aware of the nature of reality all the time. I thought a couple weeks after quitting weed I\u2019d feel better but it\u2019s still the same. I feel like I\u2019ve learned this divine truth about the world and I can\u2019t unsee it. My good trips have showed me that it\u2019s all about love and we are all one consciousness experiencing itself and all that jazz, but I\u2019m stuck in this nihilistic view from that one bad trip. I have constant brain fog and my vision feels blurry, like reality is hidden behind a layer of static. The visual snow is still there but I have to consciously try to make it happen, like I can control which direction the snow moves in with my head if that makes sense.\n\nI\u2019m really hoping this fades with time but I\u2019m really scared that it won\u2019t. I want to feel fully grounded in reality and not always thinking that life is pointless because it\u2019s gonna end anyways. I haven\u2019t done any psychs since that bad trip except weed, and I\u2019ve been clean from weed and all other drugs for 49 days. I only smoke nicotine and drink coffee. I feel really alone. I feel like a therapist wouldn\u2019t understand what I\u2019ve experienced unless they have experience with spirituality. Im sitting on a bunch of shrooms and ketamine right now that I haven\u2019t touched in over a year, I feel like a good trip would heal me but im scared of making it worse with the mindset that im in. And believe me I know the beauty psychs can reveal, my first ever trip was literally a religious experience. At one point I felt like I could never be depressed again with the wisdom and knowledge I learned. But yet here I am. Any advice for me?",

When I saw him for the first time, i felt drawn to hum but forgot about it then. Now after 6 years, we connected via social media and met. We noticed some weird similarities -\n\nWe were both reading the same book and watched the same movie recently ( quite an old movie).\n\nWe were wearing exactly same slippers(I shopped this one from the men's section lol).\n\nOur views were so damn similar about almost anything and everything.\n\nWe visited the same state around the same time and i rarely travel.\n\nAgain, we had to attend a wedding on the exact same dates in a different state.\n\nSimilar childhood experiences and traumas. Very similar.\n\nWhen we first met, we talked about how the loss of a pet affects us and 5 days later my dog passed away. This was the first time I talked about this topic with anybody.\n\nHe went for a trip to a foreign country and before he told me about it, a friend of mine visited the same country and got me a fridge magnet somehow I was thinking about this country when he mentioned that he'll be visiting the same place.\n\nWhen we met he randomly mentioned that he was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism and I was so shocked because I had the same diagnosis 2 years back and our reports were quite similar ( in the range of 5.6).\n\nOur interests are very similar. Like we instantly hit it off and could talk about anything. It was like looking at a mirror. Like he's a guy version of me.\n\nToday I was looking at my gallery and found a picture from 4 years back when I visited college on a random day. I took a picture of the tree that I liked and guess what this same guy is there in the picture and coincidentally he visited the same day as well when both of us passed out years back. And he's looking right at my camera in the picture.\n\nI've always felt like there is some connection and he felt the same. But he's recently been acting very distant so Idk what all this means but somewhere it just freaks me out and makes me believe in something but idk what to make of it.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

I think i\u2019ve heard somewhere that you enter a stream of conciousness when aligning your body in certain positions, i think yoga could be one example. \n\nMy question is that if i for example go to the gym and perform multiple exercises/positions that other people around the world are doing, am i then sharing/tapping in to the collective thoughts of all the people doing the same kinds of movements and exercises? \n\nI\u2019m asking because the last 6 months i\u2019ve taken longer periods away from the gym. And my thoughts are actually better, more pure and aligned with who I am when i stay away from the gym.\nI am missing the kick though, and the feel good hormones that are released. So ocassionally i go back to the gym for an exercise. \nAnd here is the downside and the reason for my post: The thoughts i get the couple of days after weight lifting doesn\u2019t feel like mine. It\u2019s like my catalouge of thoughts changes. I get more lower vibrational thoughts that are far from the thoughts i would like to have. It could be words like, whore, slut and so on. It sucks because I really enjoy the good parts about weight lifting i mentioned above.\n\nDo you think i am onto something here that i tap in to a lower frequency of thoughts? Or is it just my ego growing and the lower vibe thoughts come with it? \n\nI want to contribute to a better place for everyone but would also like to enjoy my experience and pleasure also. This has really divided me and i feel a little lost since working out have really been a big part of my life. \n\nThank you and blessings to you who are reading this.\nMuch love!!",

Did we ever exist before our bodies were born? \n\n## The Origin of True Self\n\nLet\u2019s go back in time, to the moment before our bodies were born into the world. There were our parents, ancestors, and the world. Let\u2019s keep going back in time to the very beginning, before our parents, ancestors, and all creations in this world were born. What would remain in that place where nothing exists? It\u2019s emptiness, nothing remains. This emptiness is the universe before the universe. It is the alpha and the omega. There is no beginning or end.\n\nAlthough it seems empty and nothing is there, it\u2019s full of energy, and that\u2019s how all creations came into existence. They came from this infinite universe emptiness that is a living existence. When our bodies disappear, they return this emptiness. This infinite universe emptiness has a body and mind. It\u2019s the emptiness and consciousness of the universe, it\u2019s also called Energy and Light, Yin and Yang, Spirit and Soul, holy father and holy spirit, dharmakaya and sambhogakaya.\n\nIn different religions they are called different names. However they all refer to the same existence. This is the mother and father of all creations and the original shape of all existence. Before the coming of Truth, it was the time of material creation, all materials existence are a representation of the emptiness itself, they have never been born and therefore there is no death - no birth, no death. However, when Truth comes as human beings, spiritual creation takes place, and that is the birth of the True Self - in Christianity they call it the holy son, Shiva in Hinduism, and nirmanakaya in Buddhism.\n\nThis is the completion of Trinity: Father, Mother and the Son. Now is this era of Truth, where everyone can be born as their true self along with the world. Then one will eternally never die, such place is Heaven, Paradise and the Land of Truth.\n\n## What Is the False Self?\n\nIf we have a true self, that means we also have a false self. So what is our false self? Our false self is the non-existent persona we\u2019ve created when we were born into the world. As we live in this world, the moment we were born, we inherited **habits** that is also DNA from our parents and ancestors, that\u2019s why we resemble how they act and behave. For example, a person with a European ancestry differs greatly from a person with African American ancestry, but people of same ancestry have similar habits and minds.\n\nOn top of these habits we\u2019ve inherited, we also created our own mind world by copying the world. We form our own belief systems, world view, and conceptions based on our life experiences through our lenses of the world, this is called **karma**. Even twins, who have the same mold, have different minds due to their own experiences and lens of the world. And our **body**, this self that we perceive to be me, it\u2019s also a non-existent and false existence. This is the so-called ego, false self, and an illusionary existence. To sum it up, what the false self is? It is the **karma**, **habits** and **body**. The reason why we are not one with our true self is because we live inside our own mind world that is a copy of the world. Only when we eliminate this mind world and the self entirely, can we live and be born again as our true self without death.\n\n## Why Must I Live As My True Self?\n\nWe are born in this world not just to live as this false existence trapped inside an illusionary world, we must awaken from this non-existent world and be born again to live as our true self. If we are unable to live as our true self, everything else is meaningless. When this body dies, we would truly disappear and die. However, when we get rid of the false self, and born again as our true self, we will live eternally as our true self. That is true happiness, joy, and freedom, which is the ultimate purpose of life. When you are living a life of falseness, you do not feel true fulfillment or happiness. Because all the money, fame, and love are temporary, there is inevitable loss and that is when we feel miserable. But when you pursue becoming your true self, and truly live to your fullest, fulfilling your true purpose in this world, you live as an honor to your true self. You feel complete and truly fulfilled as a human being.\n\nFor me, I am not someone who cries. In my life, I can count how many times I\u2019ve cried with one hand before knowing my true self. However, after realizing who my true self is and why I must live as it, every time, when I think of my true self and the possibility of becoming that, I cannot help but tears come down. Sometimes, they are so intense, that my whole body is crying and shaking, it\u2019s as if my entire soul is yearning for the person I am meant to become. I feel an extreme surge of heat throughout my body along with waves of chills that run through my spine. Every time, when I experience that, I feel like I am completely cleansed, and I am vibrating at a different level, leaving the old self behind, and embracing my new, True Self.\n\nI am longing for my true self, that self of infinite possibilities, the self of all the energy of the world, the self of complete capability and abilities, the self who has conquered his false self, the Self of victory, the Self of love, compassion, magnanimity, the Self of absolute intelligence and wisdom, the Self that is one with the universe and capable of saving the world!  \n\n\nP.S. Original post also features a poem about the true self. But it's quite long, so I won't post everything in one place, if you're interested to read it, leave the comments below.  \n\n\nHere's a snippet:\n\n**A Poem for the True Self**\r  \nTrue Self, where are you?\r  \n\r  \nTrue Self, let me see you.\r  \n\r  \nTrue Self, I've missed you..\r  \n\r  \nTrue Self, I love you so much...\r  \n\r  \nI have never loved before,\n\nTrue Self...",

While of course there is suffering and deep pain, I also have faith and love during these trying times and attempt to not resist. But, these life reevaluating pains come with usually very big life changes. As if, all of a sudden, I realize just how wrong everything feels in my life. How *spiritually hurt* and dissatisfied I am with this trajectory, which, until that day of the dark night, I thought was just fine and dandy. Growing awareness if we can call it that.\n\nDuring these times, I don't feel friendships, I feel like nobody I know currently can relate to this. I disconnect with others, as if it's a tender wound which nobody else can feel needs immediate nurturing. I know I might be  completely misperceived opening up and, often, opening up does not feel good, unless to myself/God, alone.\n\nSo here I am again, approaching my late twenties and still dealing with these 'swings.' I'm grateful for the awareness I do have, as I feel this is pain that would simply swallow, engulf, and ultimately drown some others, while I feel like I can stay afloat during the storm.\n\nThis part is maybe irrelevant, but in life, I lack friendships, usually by choice. People want to be my friend, or close to me sometimes, but it's hard to fathom ever feeling deep connection to too many when I go through these times. I've had friendships that I've needed to distance myself from because of a deep need/feeling to do such. What I also want most is a relationship, I've not been great with those, but once more, it's me more than anything. I also have complete faith this will work out. My spirit puts myself through the trenches for a reason. Some reason. I'm not always aware of it, but I know the vision I have for myself is pure, and I'd rather die than to not live a life I love, and I won't settle. I think my dark nights bring me closer to my vision. It'd be a lie to say these never make me question my faith, though.\n\nOr maybe I really don't know anything about what's going on.\n\nAll help, comments, experiences, advice, thoughts, appreciated. I will read every response. It feels so difficult.",

          "content": "So I live in the West but I have a lot of Eastern friends, predominantly from Jewish and Muslim backgrounds. When I speak to Christians and spiritual people about my Muslim friends, I sometimes get the reaction that they are barbarians, they are savages etc etc. \n\nI'm seriously broken.\n\nI am so completely paranoid. I have a Saudi Muslim friend who views the Israel Hamas war from one pov and an Israeli Jewish friend who views it from the other. Both of them think war is not ideal but they also think their side hasn't done anything bad (refusal to believe children have been bombed or women have been assaulted). I have told people that I don't stand for war and now both friends are falling away. I love them, really, I do, so much. I consider both of them family and I can't pick one over the other. They are both angry and I know that the Muslim one doesn't hate all Jews and the Jewish one doesn't hate all Muslims. I seriously think that if they were atheist and less bothered about a piece of land*, they'd make a cute couple, because they are just as funny, creative and clever as each other.\n\nMy family are also annoyed with me as they think I'm a terrorist sympathizer. I didn't ever say that but because I have arguments against why islamically certain things that have been done by extremists are wrong, they think I'm brain-washed. \"Oh look, she's justifying Islam again\". I can't argue against certain family members any longer. An Islamic cleric shouted at a lecture that \"only Allah can judge\" is a stupid thought from the Christians. My auntie argues that that means Muslims are radical and they don't care about child marriage etc because it's not criticised (when it damn well is). I then tell her that some Muslims believe they shouldn't judge others, for example: with the hijab, then I get the argument \"see, so they think anything goes because they can't judge\". Its NOT the SAME. \n\nI just can't. I had a holiday planned for Saudi Arabia this summer but now I'm worried that my family will be upset or worried about me going, especially as jokes have been made about me being a second wife by my Saudi friends. I also think they'll be angry about it. My cousin thinks UAE is like Afghanistan so who knows what she thinks of KSA. My Dad said she is ignorant, which I love \ud83e\udef6\n\nI don't get it. Why can't I just live my life? Why does everyone think I have to pick a team? I'm on the side of f@cking love. What's more is, I want my future family to be a certain way. I know deep down what I believe so I wish my family and some friends would stop pushing me about. I'm starting not to care anymore about what religion my children are, as long as they stand up for what is right,  share with the less fortunate, give the poorest more than the minimum and don't think The Creator is there to be mocked. \n\nI need some warm words. I feel as though I have no one at all. I'm now worried I am going to burn in Hell because I am turning away from Jesus who would tell me to not involve myself in this. The fact of the matter is, I'm so deeply ingrained in a monotheistic mindset which is heavily based in the Torah and Quran.  I know a load of Christians will tell me that I'm an idiot for being friends with non believers or tell me to turn to Jesus but my experience of Christians hasn't been a great one and I can see a lot of holes in certain Christian concepts.These people love me and I love them. Say what you want about their definition of love being impure but they respect me and have been there for me at no financial cost. \n\nI spoke to a secular spiritual Jew a while ago who seems like a very decent person and he asked me if I really had to pick a side. As soon as he said it, I felt a wave of calm wash over me and I felt like crying. I barely know him but it just made me feel so at peace. I'm not asking that any of you tell me this but I'd like to see your perspectives and hear some positive things that won't make me think the world is so divided or harsh.\n\n*I know its important to them but I don't think The Creator would",

He ghosted me twice within that year (first was about 2 weeks and second was about the same I don\u2019t really remember), but he came back both times. We started off being friendly to one another, but got flirty within a few months. We would text and ft so often the last few months of 2020. Then, we kinda grew a part in the early months of 2021, but still stayed in contact. I got in a serious relationship (June 2021-Nov 2023) and had to cut contact with him. Although I truly loved my partner, he would always be in the back of my mind throughout my whole relationship. I added him back a week ago (2 weeks post breakup) because I got a sudden urge to reach out. He mentioned to me he was also in 2 relationships that both lasted 8 months each. My original intentions were just to be friends and catch up, but there is clearly something more that I can\u2019t seem to avoid. Could anyone tell me what my possible connection is with this person? Idk much about soul mates, soul ties, or twin flames, but I just find it so strange that I can\u2019t seem to let this person go when I\u2019ve never even met him.

          "content": "Right from my childhood, however busy I may be, I would always feel like spending some day alone, all by myself just being with everything around me. Nothing interested me much like the silence of nature. How everything is happening without much fuss though it is no less than a miracle amazed me. Rising sun, changing seasons, different faces of the moon, variety of life around. I wondered how a human being struggles to live while simple birds and animals carry on life with dignity and harmony. \nI have been meditating for a few years now and it has given me much peace and balance. But recently, I had seen one of my friends doing a meditation called shoonya and it intrigued me so much. I felt a different sense of silence around and within her while meditating. I never felt that I should try another meditation as everything was going fine with my meditation. I immediately enrolled for the program and attended it. When I was initiated into this shoonya meditation which is about 15 minutes, I felt immensely relieved and silent. Everything within me settled and became still. And when I came out of the meditation, I realised the beauty of deep silence and the level of awareness it gives. \n\nI have been practicing shoonya meditation from that day and everyday, I touch that silence. I feel I have taken a step towards my spiritual growth by starting this meditation and hopefully it would deepen with practice. Nothing around me disturbs my peace now and it is such a huge freedom. Sense of balance and acceptance is happening so naturally in my life now. \n\nI now understand well this quote of Sadhguru : \" For those who are on the spiritual path, being alone, keeping a distance from people, and becoming silent are not issues, these are opportunities.\" \n\nThis was totally a different experience for me, so I just felt like sharing.\nAnybody else had such an experience with silence?",

I thought I actually woke up from my nap in these dreams and got up to walk around in them. \nThey were so obviously dreams but for some reason my brain is easily fooled. There were people in my house that would absolutely never be there.\n The first dream, I woke up to one of my friends in my house sleeping on the floor, we hung out a bit in the dream.\nThe second time, \u2018waking up\u2019 on the couch I saw a few people I knew from the past, wasn\u2019t anything crazy, I don\u2019t remember much from the dream other than \u2018waking up\u2019 and then walking around to talk to them. I \u2018woke up\u2019 again in the dream, reality feeling a bit more clearer. \n\nThis dream was even weirder. I got up, walked to the people that were in the kitchen, and KSI was there, I was so excited to meet him that I ended up falling down and making myself look goofy. It was pretty funny. Then a lot of other people gathered around and started eating food, this was clearly a social party. I ended up waking up again on my couch one last time, a little more awake than last time. \n\nI decided to focus on my third eye, while getting up, doing this made me fall over, and I felt all the physical sensations, I felt both my resting body and my other body that was trying walking at the same time. If you\u2019ve ever seen everything everywhere all at once, in that scene where she\u2019s at the tax office and she shifts to her alternate self, it was a bit like that. 2 different bodies. \n\nI felt my body that was resting on the couch, I stopped and relaxed a bit more, and focusing on my third eye area again. It was vibrating until the \u201cpop\u201d feeling happened. This is the first time I ever felt it. I should\u2019ve stayed laying down and meditated a bit longer, but I got up again. The reality I was in felt so clear and real that i thought I was REALLY awake this time, but no, I still ended up waking up on my couch again but for real this time. I wanted to stay in that other reality, it felt so positive and I felt much more powerful. \nHow do I stay in a reality or dream once I\u2019ve shifted to one?",

          "content": "Preface: This post is not to knock on people who do find passion/mission/purpose in their work. What I\u2019m writing is just my own experience and perception of what work means to me now. Also, I\u2019m not trying to avoid work or create an idea of good environment v.s. bad ones. But I wanted to say that seeking a spiritual like fulfillment through a job from worldly benefits does not exist.\n\nHello,\n\nfor 28 years of my life I have been seeking or partly-seeking a dream job that will fulfill my sense of passion/mission/purpose. I've tried many things from cooking, political science, marketing, design and the latest mental health. Once landing a gig in any of these industries, I thought I would reach this hooray moment where I made it. However, I learnt quickly it did not satisfy me as none of these job from a worldly POV could ever be an expression of the infinite or the truth. It dawned on me that I have to become the infinite itself, rather than searching for the right  environment to become the infinite.\n\nThe people working at jobs are often not seeking truth and many of the \u201csuccessful\u201d people I have met were definitely not happy people. A lot of them were not even desiring for a higher consciousness or deeper truth. Also, the work place often is a flawed environment of politics, power trips and ego. I\u2019m not looking down on these people, but from the perspective as a spiritual seeker finding a places that was about love they were not it. I understand there is a tantric perception to all \u201cbad\u201d places, but here I am just showing that most corporate capitalist jobs are not a explicit vigil of truth.\n\nIt seems clear to me now that I have to let go of any notion that there is a perfect job out there for me. The only perfect job for is to investigate what this ego is and to keep on searching for truth. Let God decide my external life whatever it may be and these preferences of how it should be just deludes me. Maybe paradoxically by letting go of my preference of what work to do, for once I may actually find something that I\u2019m okay doing. However, for sure I am now employed to my new spiritual job, which requires not an office or an ashram, but that we merely work on ourselves wholeheartedly. By becoming more in tune with the truth we help the whole world.\n\nTo be honest, I still feel lost right now but I do feel theres more peace in me now that this external passion/mission/purpose idea can die. Now, I can truly enjoy my true passion and mission, which is to go deeper within. If I do go work it will be because it simply is a happening that happens or I need money to live. Keeping it simple and what it should be. Right now, I am still in a bit of the illusion that finding an ashram or a temple to be a monk to be will fullfill me. Maybe I need to just experience the emptiness of that path to so that I can just be fluid into all forms of life. Either way, I\u2019m not gonna force it or place so much of an idea of what to do with my life. It\u2019s all happening as it should be.\n\n**Tl;dr,** Once you see the importance of spirituality, no external job will fulfill your passion, mission or purpose. As 99.99% jobs are not in the business of truth nor are the people there wise people. This obsession for a career, moves into the obsession for truth itself. Your external livelihood is surrendered to the divine will and done for more simple reasons like it is a happening or a means of living.",

If we have deep love and longing for God, more than a miser has for gold, more than a lover has for his beloved, more than a child has for its lost mother, if our love for God is very deep and Soulful, then this state known as Mumukshutva will lead us to God. What happens when we seek God with all our heart and Soul? We go on a quest for God. We ask the questions \u2014 who is God, where is God, what is God? Our desire for God is so deep, that we go in quest of God and ultimately, we go through the state of self- realization and then God-realization. Then we are liberated from this world and united with the Divine.",

But in order to do that, I first need to correct, and impress upon you your misguided feeling of your own importance within it.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't even be seen by the naked eye from Earth's orbit. And even then, earth itself is so small that a million of them could fit inside the sun.And even the sun is considered mediocre among all the blazing titans that could exist out there.  \n\n\nThen you have some black holes that are so large that their event horizon would encompass our entire solar system!And even that is just an engine that drives entire galaxies. And there are more of them out there than there are grains of sand on all the beaches in the world.  \n\n\nWhich bring us back to you - an insignificant little creature. You are a speck of dust under the universe's fingernails, asking to be noticed. Our entire GALAXY could just \"poof\" out of existence and the universe would keep on going with there hardly being any disturbance, how much do you believe, would a few dozen kilograms of meat and bone be really seen in the universe's eyes?  \n\n\n*Go out for a walk in clear night sky. Look up to the stars and ponder my lesson. And if you understood even the tiniest fraction of what I said, don't bother apologizing to the universe for your impertinence. Because your disrespect was noticed about as much as a cell of bacteria on your skin getting snarky.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for your connection to the universe, you ALWAYS had it. Every single building block that you consist of was made by it. And by the grace of gravity that holds all together, you are grounded to it. By the actions of forces, you are moved by it. By the laws of physics you are granted insight into it. And by the notion of quantum mechanics you are beginning to learn the groundwork underneath it.\n\n**Ergo the question of \"how do I become connected to the universe\" is entirely futile. You ARE made by the universe, you ARE molded, shaped by it, you ARE driven by it and you ALREADY ARE a part of it.**",

I rewatch old shows; however, none of it is what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nWhat am I looking for?\n\nI\u2019m looking for specific stories: those of true enlightenment in all their myriad forms.\n\nIf you have any suggestions, I\u2019m all ears. If not, then you may know the feeling.\n\nI know that what I seek already is within, but I still search for the art of being others like me.\n\nThinkers like Alan Watts,  \nFeelers like Ram Dass,  \nDrunkards like Charles Bukowski,  \nComposers like Max Richter,  \nPoets like Kahlil Gibran,    \nNovelists like Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2026  \nAnd there must be others.\n\nKafka, Tolkien, Rumi, whom else?\n\nYes, I\u2019m looking for I already have within.  \nYes, I know who is doing the looking.\n\nI guess I wonder to myself, why did God give me such gifts and troubles\u2026 why my intelligence, why my intuition, why my social ineptitude, why my loving family, why my sexual trauma, why my inherent stupidity? Why?\n\nWhy am I here? Why a human? Why now? What is there to gain from this right here and now besides what I already know? Why am I an addict? Why does my heart need this to be posted?\n\nI\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going, but I\u2019m going somewhere. It all must mean something, right? Maybe I\u2019m naive for thinking that. Maybe it\u2019s dumb to think anything means anything at all\u2026 or maybe meaning is inherent to things, or maybe meaning it\u2019s what I make of it\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\n\nIt\u2019s almost Christmas; here in America where I live but from where I\u2019m not, people complain about the language we use. Some say \u201chappy holidays\u201d, some are sneaky and say \u201cmerry Christmas\u201d. It\u2019s all kinda silly, at the end of day the intent is roughly the same.\n\nIt\u2019s all so complicated. Being human is hard, so many expectations. Be this, do that.\n\nEven amongst peers, meaning is often lost in translation\u2026\n\nAnyway\u2026 I wish to you all goodfull seasons, and I hope the message from my heart may come across as sincere. If not, well I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll let me know \ud83d\ude02",

In other words, you ALLOW that \"everything is perfect\".  \n\r  \nAnd then spend your life trying to rectify it (bhakti yoga) by accepting that you just aren't viewing it from the right angle. Whether its temporal or moral bias, \"I will die, others will, unjustly, too early, love will be wasted, time will be spent cheaply, and so on until: I can't see the overall elegant angle of life, because I am not a spectator, I am participating.\"  \r  \n(This is what Yoga really is)  \n\r  \nYoga really means, a series of exercises to bring you into union with reality or God. \"Yoking\" you into God. The Physical aspect of it is only 1/3 of Yoga. There is Jnana, Bhakti, and \"Asanas\" or poses, these differentiations aren't really important.  It's really embracing the heat of life in order to enjoy the thirst.      It's an honest turning into tribulation in order to cleanse the spirit through adversity.   \n\r  \nWhat Yoga is, is the mastery of the senses in order to view life from an angle that you can appreciate the crystallization and the unfolding of karma from a dimension that is beyond temporal constraints.  Temporal constraints: \"My perspective is limited by my mortality.\"  \n\r  \nIn other words, a crystal made of time and events.  A crystal being an organized collection of atoms in a rhythmic structure.  A civilization.  A religious temple...  A people that harness the power of stars to show the entire universe that order is the rule of the day and not just blind chaos.  \n\r  \nThen, seeing the universe as an elegant expansion of energy that will unfold lawfully, and undoubtedly harmonize into a collective equilibrium based in energy fostered by technology that makes the point of existence to rejoice in its own consciousness. Making something like a \"crystal\" of a civilization.   \n\r  \nSO harmoniously powerful that from afar it shapes star systems into a sign or something.\r  \nSome geometric shape to say that, we have reached so and so point in galactic manipulation. \n\n(Orion is rather symmetrical if you consider the rest of the sky)",

We are also experiencing \u2728free will\u2728\n\nI am sorry to spoil it to you, but we come to earth to experience and learn the most we can which means we did or will incarnate in every continents, every gender, power and also misery. So i will go further now and tell you at some point, you will (or did) experience being a victim of abuse, being a savior of someone but also, being the abuser. Yes, you don't have to accept it but try to understand by lowering your ego on the question. \n\nLet's get back to Adolf H (or any other abuser/evil). I'm not exposing this as a theory, but this is what i think, happened to the guy when he came back in the spirit world\nGot greeted by his guide and quickly taken to that place they \"redirect\" and kinda cleanse the bad energy sticking to his soul. He then had to re see and discuss about it with his guides (long) \nNow, he prob still is reflecting on his life and what he has done and what he learned from it. In his next life, he will most likely have to go trough tough karma. For exemple, it will be his turn to be a victim. (please dont picture the guy face in your head in the spirit world lol) \n\nSo yeah. I get that it's hard to accept. And yes people who made others suffer deserve justice and to rot in a cage for as long as possible (to me at least, i'm not really for the death penalty) \n\nRemember what i said is not everything or the \"absolute\" truth, but this is some sort of agreement from people around the world who seeked answears with mediation, hypnosis",

(Not really relevant what I believe, but regardless, dreams are super interesting and wild).  \nI couldn't find an honest and decent site that wasn't ridden with ads to track my dreams easily; so I've done a heap tonne of research, sent lots of questions to enlightened souls to help me with my dream website and have gained an unbelievable amount of knowledge, and thus have created my very own dream meaning explorer!  \nI share this in hopes it will help you on your journey and to also encourage you to keep a little diary of your dreams. Take a few minutes out of your day to note down their potential meanings. Because when you revisit this, you might just find an answer that you couldn't see before, it's really quite something! If you remember anything about a previous dream, give it a looksy!  \nwww.mydreamexplorer.com",

          "content": "\\-Q&A with Swami BV Tripurari  \n\n\nQ. Having had this experience myself, I feel that the description of the universal form (Visvarupa) found in the 11th chapter of Bhagavad-gita is but a metaphor for the intense mystic state that occurs when one ingests a sufficient amount of psilocybin. In religious cultures throughout the ages this chemical substance of plant origin has been used to produce mystical visions. Initially these visions cause great confusion, which corresponds to Arjuna's fear upon first seeing the Visvarupa. Ultimately, this confusion transforms into an intense sense of well-being and enlightenment. Do you have any comments on this?  \n\n\nA. Research shows that visual experiences derived from the use of hallucinogenic drugs vary in relation to one's mental preoccupation. Therefore, persons who use drugs for spiritual purposes will likely have visions corresponding with their particular religious preoccupation. For example, Native Americans and others who practice nature-based religions are said to often experience themselves as animal spirits. Hindus might have visions they imagine (as you did) to be akin to Arjuna's experience of the Visvarupa as described in the Gita, and Christians might perceive their visions as related to the second coming of Christ. Tellingly, persons with no spiritual background or interest whatsoever will hallucinate in terms of their own materialistic interests. Obsessed with the Beatles song Helter Skelter, the drug- induced visions of Charles Manson were of an apocalyptic racial war, one that he personally tried to bring about by murdering innocent people. Nothing at all spiritual about that!  \n\n\nAlthough there are a few Hindu sects that smoke ganja or take hallucinogens in quest of enlightenment, the spiritual mainstream of Hinduism dismisses those who seek to tie hallucinogens to the mystic ideal of the Bhagavad-gita. Indeed, the text clearly points out that Arjuna's vision of the Visvarupa was a blessing from Krsna, the result of his intimate devotion, and had absolutely nothing to do with psilocybin or any other drug. Neither is the use of hallucinogens for spiritual purposes recommended anywhere in the Gita.  \n\n\nUnder the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, one may have visions of Krsna, Buddha, Jesus, or dancing elephants for that matter, but such visions are only temporary creations of the mind. The real Krsna is adhoksaja, beyond the limitations of the mind. His darsana is available to persons like Arjuna, who through their devotion have become his intimate friends. Bhagavad-gita (11.53-54) says that to such great souls Krsna gives the transcendental eyes with which to see him in truth.",

It's really fascinating to me how they can both contribute to the madness of the ego by the role they play in the industry, but still be aware of how it is all built on an illusion.\n\nFor instance, it's strange how Marilyn Monroe is mostly seen as a sex-symbol and an object of lust, while she was an incredibly sensitive and lucid person. She used the power of illusion to her advantage by inventing a persona. She was smart but used the dumb blonde stereotype in order to get what she wanted. It's as if she was stuck in a sort of spiritual limbo - she understood and used the concept of illusion of the self but still ended up getting hurt by the harsh reality of Hollywood.\n\nAnother example that comes to my mind is Jim Carrey - although that's a very different story from Marilyn's.",

Which makes it challenging as a lot of the old programs are being touched on. \n\nShes very sexual.  As much by nature as by her alluring appearance.  I'd like to think she is sexually free and that brings up a host of things for me, judgement at times and also a longing to be as free. Which normally clashes with my sense of values or morality.  I'm more demi-sexual and having many partners seems to go against my long standing beliefs.  Yet, I'm miserable so, probably time to challenge a lot of this stuff.\n\nDoesn't help that I'm very ashamed by my body and have been nominally rejected much of my life.  \n\nAdd in the trauma wounds of being alone for so long, its hard to let down and explore anything with anyone, but most women, especially more normal won't want to be apart of said healing I imagine. \n\nMy feminine probably needs some work as well not going to lie.

          "content": "\u2728 How to Manifest\n\n1. Suspend disbelief\n\nThis step, what Bernstein calls \"clearing space,\" is necessary before even beginning the actual manifesting process.\n\nIt involves ridding yourself of the disbelief that you can\u2019t/won\u2019t be happy\u2014clearing out that space in your head so you\u2019re no longer blocking yourself from your great potential. Says Bernstein, \"Before you begin the manifestation process, you must take the necessary time to release all your disbelief in your power to be happy.\"\n\nDesiring your dream job? Stop telling yourself that it\u2019s impossible to get, too competitive, you\u2019re not qualified, etc. Cut those limiting beliefs and negative emotions out. Believe that you can get it and that you\u2019ll kill it. That\u2019s your first step.\n\n2. Clarify what you actually want\n\n\u2026and get specific.\n\nIn order to get what you truly desire, you must be crystal clear about what exactly that is. Clarify your intentions so that you know exactly what it is you\u2019re seeking. Bernstein suggests you make a list of precisely what you want because \"this list helps you clarify your intentions and access a vibrant mental picture of what you desire.\" And most important, according to Bernstein, is that you get clear about how you want to feel. When you clarify what you want to feel, you can start to tap into those feelings.\n\nWhat appeals to you about the job? The company atmosphere? The flexible hours? The opportunity to exercise your creativity? Write it all down. Then think about how these aspects will make you feel\u2014fulfilled, proud, entertained? Get specific!\n\n3. Set Aside Actual Time to Imagine Experiencing Reaching Your Goals\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set those clear intention(s), take time each day to soak in the feeling of what you want. This can be done in various ways, but popular ones are meditation and visioning exercises.\n\nThe more you take time to feel the feeling of what you ultimately desire, the closer you will be to attaining it.\n\nCarve time out of each day to take action. Sit in your favorite outdoor spot or walk a quiet path and really envision yourself where you want to be. Soak in the feeling of shaking your future boss\u2019s hand and accepting the position, completing your first big project at the new job, establishing healthy and strong connections with your coworkers, etc.\n\nYou can also try visualization techniques, reciting positive affirmations, and setting aside any negative thoughts that arise in the process.\n\n4. Stop Worrying So Much\n\nBernstein calls this the \"Chill!\" principle. But basically: patience and faith are key.\n\nTo really manifest your wants into reality, it\u2019s crucial to relax and wait without anxiety. Understand that the universe may not be on the same time schedule as you, but that it knows better anyway.\n\n5. Have a little faith\n\n\u201cGetting in the know\u201d is a natural occurrence. Principles one to four will guide you to being in the know\u2014a state where you no longer fear or experience doubt. Instead, you know you\u2019re exactly where you need to be. Says Bernstein, \"When you feel it, you live it\u2014regardless of what is happening on the outside. In time, the universe catches up with your energy and your desires come into form. \"\n\nRemember that it ultimately comes from the inside\u2014if you feel it internally, you can live it, regardless of where you currently are. The universe will catch up eventually as your desires manifest into form.\n\nHave faith in where you are, and remember it\u2019s where you need to be. Your desired job or position will come when it\u2019s meant to. Until then, trust the process.",

Left my friends, life, community - but knew it was time to go. \n\n- started over alone in a new city \n\n- I stopped talking to 2 of my close friends who I realized were toxic and energy vampires and reminded me of my abusive ex \n\n- experienced spiritual downloads\n\n- remembered two past lives via channeling / automatic writing (unprompted) \n\n- have experienced heightened synchronicities \n\n- have experienced telepathy (unprompted)\n\n- have experienced astral projection \n\nAfter these experiences I feel so different. I feel better and my chakras as open and I am aligned. It is awesome. \n- \nANYWAY - I am posting today bc I saw another best friend from college for the first time since my awakening and I noticed how negative and out of alignment she was and I feel myself not wanting to be as close to her anymore because her energy was so very negative and hard to be around. She is not willing to do the self work needed to heal either. \n\nWill I just keep losing friends who are stuck in their ego? It\u2019s so hard. I love her but wow I feel physically ill after 3 days with her. \n\nIdk if this post makes any sense.

I describe it as an orb that fluctuates around me and spilling out into the world and that scares me for some reason. \n\nMy dreams scare me because I have an ability to see scenes or snapshots of real life in my dreams and days or months later they play out in real life. For example I remember vividly of having a dream of me being on a school bus with my classmates driving through a country road surrounded by fields of grass, hay and cows with white fences on each side of the road. I never thought anything of it until weeks later I\u2019m on a school bus with my classmates headed to college station for a basketball game and out of no where I see the whole scene play out in front of my eyes. I was so stunned and spooked the rest of the day and got a really bad headache after that happened. I didn\u2019t tell anybody about that because I didn\u2019t wanna be labeled as crazy so I kept it quiet. \n\nThat happened when I was about 15. Since then throughout high school I tried to force myself to not go to sleep simply because of that occurrence. I believe that that\u2019s happened my whole life but with that particular experience I felt that I now became fully aware of what was happening. Becoming aware of what takes place when I sleep made me not want to sleep anymore so I slept less which is a bad thing. \n\nWhen I got to college I discovered weed and vaping and I have become addicted to them to this day. At first it was cool and all until I noticed that the occurrences have died down but not have gone away because I still experience it every once in a while. I feel like me smoking has suppressed the ability but hasn\u2019t terminated it all. It\u2019s almost as if the flames were huge and the smoking has turned it into a slow and small flame. \n\nI fear that if I stopped than my energy and spiritually senses while spike and I\u2019m afraid of it happening because I\u2019m scared and don\u2019t know what to make of it at all. \n\nI looked this up and it came up of precognition. It could be that or deja vu. But I don\u2019t see how it could be deja vu when I see these scenes in my dreams. Could it be something spiritual? Should I not be scared and embrace it? Anyone else feel like this? Or witness it? Hopefully this made sense",

Since I have been an early teenager, I have always been interested in spirituality - knowing what is beyond this world and also the essence of this world. When I was a kid, science was extremely fascinating to me - and continues to this day, that is one of the reasons I chose medicine as my profession and I am happy I made this choice, even though I am not yet a doctor. However, I believe that is something \"more\" to life. I am educated on spiritual principles like God, soul, reincarnation, karma, karmic laws, diseases are in their core manifested in order to teach you a lesson and protect the soul, our world is just a material image and not an absolute reality and so on. Just to clarify, I am happy with who I am and to be alive and healthy.  \n\n\nI am saying all this to explain what my true interest lies in - understanding more of the metaphysical stuff, so to call it.  \n\n\nThe discourse comes with my interests and my age. Since I am a man who does things when I think are important to me *(you know, I don't smoke because it is bad for your health, and also study medicine because not only this will get me far in life, but it is a morally good profession)*, I basically do not take interest in things like sex, relationships, hobbies, cars, anime or most things people my age generally do in their free time. An example is that I do not exercise - yes, in theory it would be good to have a fit body, but given the amount of pain and time I have to invest for something I do not really care about, I don't consider it right. To explain, it is not that I want to do those things and am practicing abstinence, I am genuinely not interested in anything not related to my studying right now. **This has me wondering, is there something wrong with me, or it just people shoving their understandings of what is right to do?**  \nFor example, one of my friends accused me of not going out and trying new things and experiencing life but only loving listening to people's stories about their experiences. He said that it is stupid to have most of you experience come from observation and not through trial and error or something like that. He said I am a bit like a coward for fearing negative experiences, because in his words, there isn't a bad experience, only building of character. I love talking to people, hearing new viewpoints, questioning my beliefs in a constructive discussion... not trying to impress girls or collecting manga etc.   \n\n\nI hope this post would attract the attention of those who have been in my position and know how to traverse their spiritual path through it.

I appreciate you in advance if you read this whole thing. \n\nTw: mentions of religious trauma and ED.\n\nShort background: I was raised strictly Catholic and went to Catholic school until I was 13. I have some religious trauma from childhood and never fully believed in or resonated with Catholicism, so between ages of like 13-20 I didn't believe in anything, and I tried not to think about it due to the difficulties I had with religion in the past. I was also just a rebellious teenager who didn't really care, tbh. I liked the \"fuck you\" of refusing to go to church with my parents.  \n\nCome COVID in 2020, I was feeling so lost and hopeless. I was consumed in my ED, living at home with my parents again after my college was shut down, drinking every night to distract myself. One night I felt called to read, and ended up finding \"Journey of Souls\" by Michael Newton. Reading this book seriously changed everything for me. I stopped having panic attacks when I thought about death, and the entire premise of the book brought me so much comfort. I felt like I finally understand what this thing, \"spirituality,\" was, and how it could help me in my life. It felt like a missing puzzle piece. \n\nI became enamored with metaphysics, spirituality, meditation, all the things. My self esteem improved so much, I've resolved many of my past ED concerns, I reached out for support for my depression, and a lot of good has come from it. I started meditating, studying astrology, doing yoga, collecting crystals, paying attention to my intuition, reading tarot, and really feeling spiritually connected. I felt faithful, hopeful, and sure. \n\nFast forward 4 years. I'm 24 now, just moved across the country, and suddenly I'm starting to question beliefs that I previously felt steadfast in. My mind is starting to take me way deeper than the seemingly simple spiritual principles that I've held onto since 2020. What used to bring me comfort isn't enough. \n\nI feel like all of the work I've put into my spirituality and self improvement is meaningless because it's tied to my own ego. I know that I'm just my soul. My thoughts, personality, mind and physical self are not me. It's started to feel meaningless to try making myself \"feel good,\" through things like dressing up, doing my makeup, even enjoying a nice meal. It feels empty. Like all of these feel good things are just there to feed my ego. The things I used to attach to as my personality and \"who I am\" are disappearing. They're not making sense. \n\nI want to get back to myself, my soul. I don't know what to do to move forward and learn from this. I don't even know if any of this will make sense to anyone who reads it.\n\nIf someone out there has been through something similar I'd love to hear about it. <3",

Think about it for a sec cause for me, it translates to the universe feeling \u201cbored\u201d or \u201clonely\u201d. Like it had a reason to do this. Like the universe was acting out of emotion. Why did it feel the need to do any of this? Why did we need to find the way back to the light if we were there in the first place? That means that the universe was bored/lonely(?)

Every restaurant i go to lately has excessive, obnoxious amounts of tvs. You can\u2019t even look anywhere without a screen in your face other than the ceiling or floor. I know there have always been tvs in restaurants but the least two years or so it\u2019s absolutely overkill. I don\u2019t get it. And it\u2019s unnerving to say the least. I look around at the other people and everyone seems just fine with it.   2.  Ive been seeing these ads lately for the hemp (?) gummies that supposedly you can choose the mood you want. I believe one of the companies is actually called \u201cMood\u201d.  I\u2019ve always felt kind of indifferent towards drinking and drugs, I drink once in a while and have not really experimented much with pot or anything else and I\u2019m not necessarily against any of it but something about these ads is rubbing me the wrong way.   Both of these things feel kind of horrifying to me. Anyone else have similar thoughts?",

          "author": "sasha1695",
          "content": "How do you release trauma?\n\nHello! \n\nIm new to this sub and would love any advice from people with personal experience and hope the wisdom you give me can help others. This is long so there is a TLDR at the bottom \ud83d\udc9c\n\nAside from therapy, medication etc I really think my body has stored so much trauma from my childhood and some unfortunate events in adulthood that my body is never at ease it as always anxious, my mind always ruminates and I find myself always longing for more and never being happy with life. For example I\u2019m going through the worst break up of my life right now (dated for 4 years)  at 28 years old and it feels like I don\u2019t even want to live without him and found myself sobbing, horribly depressed and I even rock back and forth to soothe myself. I genuinely do not want to live a life without him. I realize that my reaction is a bit dramatic but I think there is a source to this and it\u2019s my childhood trauma\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 5 and I lived with my mother, she loved very much from the stories I hear and the notes she wrote me as a baby, but I never got my emotional needs met from her, she spent most of her time in her room. I was lucky if I was fed 3 meals a day and the house was a disgusting mess. But this was normal for me and I didn\u2019t think anything of it. It wasn\u2019t until I was 11 years old that I realized she wasn\u2019t mentally well. She had a mental breakdown and \u201ckidnapped\u201d me, took my phone so I could t contact my dad and drove endlessly for hours telling me that we were in danger and needed to run. I still remember her screams as she banged on the steering wheel of the car cursing out the \u201cdemons\u201d that are attacking us. For whatever reason although I loved my mom and knew she would never hurt me I knew I had to steal my phone back and call the cops/my dad. Once they found us she was officially diagnosed with severe paranoid schizophrenia. I felt immeasurable guilt for being the reason she lost me and ended up in a psyche ward. I rejected her afterwards and almost feared her despite knowing I was the one thing she loved in this world, I know I was young but I blame myself. To this day I have never spoken to her again out of fear, she also decided to move with family in Venezuela and idk where she is and for that I feel guilt too\n\nBut on the bright side, I got to love full-time with my father. My father is sincerely the kindest, funniest, purest soul to touch this earth. He was selfless and always giving to people and making everyone laugh. He was everything I could need after the trauma and he\u2019s was the best dad in the entire world I wouldn\u2019t trade him for anything. Tragically, when I was 16 years old he died suddenly when a drunk driver hit him. This was 10000 times worse than losing my mother and the only thing that could be worse than this loss is me possibly losing a child one day. \n\nThe only \u201cparental\u201d figure left was my stepmom, the woman my dad remarried when I was about 8 years old. Well to be frank I resented her, she blamed me for her relationship problems, she always yelled at me and scolded me and told me I wasn\u2019t good enough. I barely remember any emotional support from her. Even thought I never snuck out or did hardcore drugs in school and was a good egg NOTHING was good enough for her. The tiniest messes I left triggered her OCD and she would show anger to me for the rest of the day. When I grew older she made me feel guilty for not visiting her more and saying I owed her for her taking custody of me and giving me a home when I lost my parents. I will say our relationship is much more normal and she apologized for how she treated me and started trying to change her ways. But that doesn\u2019t change how my view of relationships was forever affected by the 3 of them\n\nI have dealt with anxious attachment styles, constant illnesses and medications and chronic pain as well as chronic depressions, anxiety and passive suicidal thoughts. I know I have to release my trauma from my body, heal my inner child, forgive myself and my parents, forgive God for what he let happen and go through a spiritual awakening to complete my life\u2019s purpose and teach others how to heal their trauma\n\nTLDR: I lost my mother by age 11 due to schizophrenia, my dad by age 16 from an accident, and my stepmother was mean, and gave me no emotional/motherly support. My whole life I have had health issues and mental health issues such as anxiety, depression and finding no fullfilment in life. Aside from therapy and medication I think it\u2019s more powerful to do inner child healing, energy work and shadow work. How do you release trauma from the body?",

He said: \"Behold: In a sacred forest a beautiful parrot was the proud mother of two younglings.\r  \n565. But lo: while still tiny, the two younglings were stolen from the nest by a hunter.\r  \n566. The mother parrot had left her nest unattended to go in search of food; it was then that the hunter \rsnatched the baby parrot\r  \n567. \u201cAfter some days, one of the baby parrots escaped from the hunter.\r  \n568. Even so, he was too far from home to find his mother.\r  \n569. As it happened, he was found by a holy woman.\r  \n570. Lo: she raised that baby parrot as she would her own child.\r  \n571. Yea, the parrot lived his life with her, hearing lovely words, seeing beautiful deed\r  \n572. \u201cRemember that I said there were two baby parrots snatched from their nest by the hunter.\r  \n573. You have now heard what happened to the fortunate one that escaped.\r  \n574. As to the other parrot that did not escape, lo, he lived his life in a cage at the house of the hunter.\r  \n575. In that house, he grew up hearing ugly words, seeing violent deeds.\r  \n576. \u201cWhen each of the stolen parrots was seven years of age, the following event occurred.\r  \n577. Behold: the king of this land, traveling in the forest, was separated from his horse.\r  \n578. For, lo: the horse spooked, having been scared by a snake; the king was thrown to the ground.\r  \n579. Though unharmed by the fall, the king could not retrieve his horse.\r  \n580. Wherefore the king walked to the nearest house, which happened to be the home of the hunter.\r  \n581. As the king approached the home, he was greeted by the words of the parrot that had been raised \rby the hunter.\r  \n582. That parrot, the one that had not escaped the hunter, still lived in the cage.\r  \n583. The parrot, seeing the king approach, parroted the sort of words that he had been raised on.\r  \n584. He squawked: \u2018Beat and rob him! 585. Bind and cage him!\u2019\r  \n586. The king, hearing those words coming from the home of the hunter, turned and ran the other \rdirection, fleeing from the home of the hunter  \n587. \u201cAfter a few miles, the king came to another home in the forest, a cabin surrounded by flowers and a vegetable garden.  \n588. This was the home of the holy woman who had found the parrot that had escaped the hunter.  \n589. The parrot had happily lived with her for seven years, ever since she befriended him upon his escape.  \n590. Behold: though he was not caged and could leave if he wished, he willingly stayed.  \n591. From his perch on the garden fence, the parrot saw the king approach.  \n592. The parrot did what parrots do: he parroted the sort of words that he had been raised on.  \n593. He sang: \u2018An honored guest!  \n594. Welcome to our table!  \n595. Have a warm bath and a glass of our best wine!\u2019  \n596. The king, hearing the warm words of welcome, knocked upon the door of the holy woman.  \n597. Lo: she greeted him and treated him like a king, though she knew not that he was the king of the land.  \n598. \u201cAfter his warm bath and delicious meal of roasted vegetables with a mug of mead, the king revealed his identity to the woman.  \n599. Then he described his experience with the first parrot and its foul words, and compared that to his warm welcome by her sweet parrot.  \n600. The king said, \u2018Thus the old adage is proved true: The upbringing of a beast or man is at least as important as the bloodline.\u2019  \n601. \u201cThe holy woman lent the king her horse so that he could return to his palace.  \n602. A week later, a messenger arrived at the home of the holy woman.  \n603. He gave the woman a string of seven horses, one being the horse she had lent to the king.  \n604. Each horse carried a pouch filled with gold.  \n605. The messenger said, \u2018The horses and gold are a gift from the king, a token of his appreciation.  \n606. He also sends the following message: ' A parrot singing compassionate words is an ambassador of the one parroted!  \n607. Yahshua ended his story to the teens beneath the tree by saying: \u201cAs with parrots, so with children.  \n608. Wherefore, we pray that children with unpleasant parents will do what is possible but not easy,   \nwhich is to cleanse their minds with spiritual water that they may be purified from the parroting of their unpleasant parents.  \n609. Behold: It is much easier for a child of pleasant parents to walk the path of pleasantness when an adult.  \n610. Wherefore 1 say to parents: Lead your children onto the path of pleasantness by walking that path.\"",

          "author": "fahiym",
          "content": "The year was 1997 Atlanta and I was In 7th grade.I had experienced the death of a childhood friend who was only a few years older then me. The death was not easy to process and i was filled with so much Grief and anger that all I did was mope around or fake smiles when people questioned my emotional state. It didn't feel sustainable but also i didn't have the energy to do much else. \nwhile skipping school (now around this time No child left behind was new policy in schools that pretty much meant you could fail all your classes or not show up at all and the school would bump you up to the next grade).I was walking aimlessly through the Art District of downtown and came across a tea house. I was not much for tea but i thought they might have some tasty desserts, they did, i placed my order for a cake looking dessert that i never had and i soon found myself just waiting at a small table observing the wait staff. they'll were very comfortably dressed and took a long time with my order. they'll wore a lot dark blues and orange, not stereotypical monk robes but a mix between something you might wear at the gym and maids outfit. they'll were very strong carrying what could have been 20 cups of tea on one large serving tray. Finally some adult came over and sat in the chair across from me. I was expecting A lecture or a demand regarding why I was not in school. I don't recall what the first question was but i recalled it being so far from my expectation that I smiled. The monk complimented me on my smile but then also remarked that it was sad and that perhaps there was a beautiful story behind it. \nAt the time I took it as a challenge and told the monk the story of my friends death. They were a good A very good listener, their reaction was not one of pity and this was my first time experiencing an adult who was okay with sadness. The monk's name was Azeem and they talked to me for like hour. The monk explained that the tea house was also a monastery, I never heard of the word \"monastery\" before that day and so they also explained it as \"a school for studying your attractions and finding your tribe again\". They invited me to come back and i felt better about the death of friend having been heard out.\nI would keep coming back to Tea house/ monastery for the better part of two years. i learned really cool physical exercises and mental exercises but didn't think of my time there as spiritual, it was healing and I just enjoyed the attention, love and all the learning monks had to offer. i loved being there way better then I liked public school. The monastery had 4 major sets of thoughts Meditation, awakening, dreams and death which the monks and I explored in two hour long conversations that centered my observations in the world and the monk's teachings or \"the order \" or what might be called now \"their wisdom traditions\". it was not always the same monk teaching me but they seem to know the same body of Knowledge.\nI would leave town In 1999 moving with my family to the suburbs of Kernersville. I stay in contact with Azeem by AOL messager and phone calls from a land line. They would also send me letters from time to time to help me  continue my study for years. It was during this time I recognized it as a spiritual practice. it was not a secret but I also didn't go out my way to explain it or talk about it.  \"the order \" or \"their wisdom traditions\" has no name and they actively rejected the idea of putting a name on it, In some ways that made it invisible in my mind, it felt like a hobby with no hashtag. 2004 I graduated from the only other high school in Kernersville and kind of set aside the studying to try to apply what I learned. \ntime skip to 2018. I was visited by Azeem who Invites me to be Initiated into becoming a teacher. I was not really interested In teaching but Azeem did not kedp up with communication technologies. The collective of monks who they traveled around with all shared one cell phone, can you imagine? also they hadn't had a reliable physical address in years. Only because the opportunity might not come back around for years did I volunteer for the initiation. the rights were not easy(and i might explain the ritual some other day) but I become a teacher but with no desire to teach. a year after that wss 2019 The Covid 19 times which gave me some time to reengage with the study and practice. I had a change of heart in 2023 and decided to teach. traditionally teachings works something like: \nI would go out and travel the country side within the geographical boundaries of whatever language I speak \nteach people in exchange for money or whatever basic needs I have. carrying and owning only what I can pack and staying for as long as there are people Interested in the teachings. \nthen at some point If I find a place where a lots of people are interested in in the teachings establish a monastery.\nwhich all sounds cool but would obviously be ridiculous because in America were the last thing we look for in the homeless is Spiritual wisdom.\nHow do I stay true to the spirit of this tradition while adapting it for 2023?\n\nmy first thought was I could be a social media influencer. but the thing about spirituality as i know it and all the noise that you hear on social media about spirituality is context. Its not that they are all wrong or crazy but without careful context to all the woo woo and buzz words associated with spirituality losses so much meaning the quickness and pressure to tell people exactly what they want to hear the keep them engaged.\nfor now I work a full time job at a local business that super flexible with hours. i am essentially I'm their \"monk in residency\" what I do is offer personal sessions to people Interested in spirituality and the order. I take off two hours of work per session and I ask that my students pay my hourly rate for the time I am taking to be with them rather working at the business. I also started a patron to set out some choose content and get support that way. its working for now but if I could teach full time that would be the dream. thanks for reading.",

I even had dreams where I was unable to speak and it was stifling. A tarot reading I got when I was 15 resonated when she said I am not being creative when I should be(badly paraphrasing). I know the rational thing is to just practice and do it thats the only way to get better, but its like if creating art was the only way to express myself, but as an artist I dont have the know how to do certain things, and I dont have the ability to fulfill to the piece I created in my head. Its suffocating. I really want to be good at some kind of creative expression.:(",

I decide to close my eyes, feel, and meditate.\n\n Shortly after a voice appears in my head saying a great spiritual presence has been detected in a tone that seemed like it was directed at someone other than myself, and I felt like I heard the voice through some secret spy equipment. \n\n As I hear this I get goosebumps and start to feel something pulling me toward a vision which is of me super happy and fulfilled.  Then I suddenly \u201cpop out of that vision\u201d to see a pinkish bubble which felt like my energy, and a bluish bubble that felt like the energy of the vision I was seeing. \n\n I saw these as two separate glowing orbs slowly spinning around each other like they were two particles about to collide.  Eventually they started spinning closer and closer together until they became one and in that instant I temporarily forgot what happened and opened my eyes.  After a couple seconds I was able to piece back the events I previously described like you do from a dream in the morning.\n\n  I\u2019m now sitting next to my strained noodles freaking out thinking I\u2019ve gone insane.  It felt like I merged with the vision in actual reality.",

          "author": "masterkushroshi",
          "content": "Astral Traveling is a wonderful but potent, first step on the journey. It allows for the strong potential of heavy development of visualizations. Additionally it allows full embodiment of the senses through non-physical means. Finally allowing one to recognize a deeper level of self that might be perceived as a soul with memory or \"astral body\". All of these skills and perceptions will become vital pillars for experiencing even deeper levels of self and knowledge, further on the journey.\n\n\nAstral travel, which usually lasts around 30 minutes, (or however long the drummer lasts) can be accomplished while laying flat on the back with the bare minimum of three different steps. These steps include a combination of shamanic drumming, being classified as a rhythmic drumming that follows 180- 250 BPM. Holotropic breathing technique as timed inhales and exhales, coming in through the nose and out through the mouth with every breath. Finally and  most importantly the will or the intention of experiencing this state of being. \n\n\nAt the beginning of the holotropic breathing technique while breathing in, one focuses on pushing out the bottom of the stomach to expand the lungs to their full potential. Starting out with ten second inhales and exhales until one is comfortable and is ready to go further. Next, moving to nine second inhales and exhales until one is comfortable and ready to go further, into eight second inhales and exhales. This pattern continues all the way down to two seconds. Then once one is comfortable and is ready to go further, one then starts the same pattern but going back the other way entirely. Slowly leading to a full ten second inhale and exhale. Once one is comfortable with that pattern of breath, they then turn their focus to the physical sensations and to the mind. \n\n\nWhen both the holotropic breathing and the drumming are used together, the particular breathing technique acts as a catalyst to fully involve the physical sensations into the new environment you'll be entering (astral plane). While the drumming acts as a vehicle to carry you there. It is highly recommended that such experiences are done in comfortable environments such as a private room with a bed, or floor cushions where one's work will not be interpreted. Once the drumming is activated and you're at the end of the breathing pattern, one then focuses on the remaining physical sensation and then mind. \n\n\nEven though one goes through the act of \"leaving\" the body, one still has an experience of the bodily senses through this new perspective. However,  while in this new state of being, the sensation of leaving is not a physical action, it is referred to as a sensation of \"astral body sense\". Now after having reached the end of the breathing pattern, one uses both the physical senses and the will of mind to go through the mental action of sitting up from whatever position they were lying in previously. The key being,  without \"actually\" moving your muscles. From this sitting perspective one's attention is fully directed towards experiencing this new position in the room one resides in. As In assuming the physical feeling of naturally being in that position. \n\n\nPresumably one's placement in a room would be on top of a bed or ground roll, in such cases one would then swing both legs off the structure. Again, using both the physical senses and the will of mind to complete this action. Next pause for a second, and take as long as necessary to accept this new position and perspective in the room. Once stable, one then stands up. Again, using both the physical senses and the will of mind to complete this action. It can help to go through each action meticulously for steady embodiment of the senses. The next and final movement is arguably the most important, as one then promptly turns around, to look downwards and accept this new perspective you are certainly experiencing. That this view is real. And the body you are looking at, on that familiar bed, was moments ago all you knew, as it suddenly becomes yours and no longer \"you\".\n\n\nRough visualizations such as simple outlines (corners, edges of furniture) of the room one is attempting the practice in, may make the transforming state of mind and personal perspective easier.  Now one can choose to visualize their position in the room changing slowly as they begin to sit up, from quarter position then slowly to half, however once one is fully seated in the up position there is no longer a need for conscious focus of visualization. The change of perspective and the environment become natural, and very fluid as one adjusts to a different state of being.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations! You're there! Once in such a space, something you will notice among many peculiar things is that the connection is not lost to the body but instead stands permanently glued to the astral form. This connection can manifest in many different ways for different people. In general the connection is usually in the form of a string or rope leaving from the astral forms navel connecting to the physical body. This is an extremely useful tool. As when in such a space, whenever one desires or needs this rope can be used to find your way or bring you immediately to the room of your body and safety.\u00a0 Meeting positive Guides In astral form can be another incredibly useful tool when first traversing the magnitude of the collective unconscious. Additionally when in such a space for assistants to better establish the vividness of the experience, one may interact with their surrounding environment through touch. It helps to really focus on the thing that you are touching and then to really embrace it.\u00a0\n\nThere are many helpful things one can learn in the astral plane. This may include meetings with guides and strong experiences that allow for strong developmental learning. However really all you need is the first three things that were stated such as strong visualization, embodiment of senses, and recognition of soul to progress to the second step of the journey.",

I feel like i cant open myself and feel free while loving myself because i have some fear blocked in my energy. Im guessing this might be trauma related but i cant seem to solve it by myself. I cant understand if i should find something to \"love\" or enjoy, or what am i missing in my life. All of this keeps me always in chronic stress.

I don't completely trust or feel safe being in that state of quiet mind meditation, microdosing psychedelics and breath work give you for too long. Indeed I realized it this way: I'm addicted to having a very noisy and cloudy mind. Although it doesn't let me be free, at least \"it feels familiar\" which you know, it's all my defense mechanisms care about. \n\nAll of my current toxic patterns involve filling up my head with noise again. Whether it be talking to my most problematic friend and listening to her issues plus giving advice and making up weird stories with her, or theorizing about deep philosophical or psychological questions or theorizing about my friends' minds, or ruminating, or listening to music all day, or studying my own mind, indentifying new patterns and thoughts processes, or daydreaming, etc. It gives me the semi detachment to the present moment I need in order to feel safe. I induce myself to dissociate through thinking \"profound thoughts\" and I truly don't want to let go of this habit. I'm amazed by this. I think of myself as a very intelligent person and place most of my social value in the fact that I'm deep and know stuff. And not only that, but even if I spend months not sharing anything happening in my head, as long as I listen to my own depth (\ud83d\ude2d) I'm fine. \nI realized that in order to find peace, I have to let go of my intellect, my mind in general and anything related to it. I have to be ok with having no thoughts for a whole day.\n\nI'd like to know what happened to you \"intellectuals\" who now spend most of you time living in the present moment head empty no thoughts? How is your career life, your creativity and productivity? Are you doing greater and more meaningful things than before?\n\nThe thing is that I don't imagine myself without this headspace.

          "author": "ChiMeraRa",
          "content": "It all started with the devil rebelling in Heaven. This is like an analogy, it\u2019s an allegory used to describe something profound that presume to provide some background information and shed light onto existence itself.\n\nWhy is there so much suffering and death?\n\nHow could a truly benevolent God allow for us to suffer? God must not be omnipotent. If God is omnipotent and allows us to suffer then God must not be truly benevolent.\n\nIt\u2019s because the devil rebelled and God zapped him that\u2019s what allowed sin to enter the world.\n\nWe are in the middle of a zap\u26a1\ufe0f\n\nThis zap started with The Big Bang \ud83d\udca5 and is ongoing, it\u2019s in the middle of God using omnipotence.\n\nThere were many things that could have happened with this zap, and completely at random, the result settled on a physical existence playing itself out with causalities over time.\n\nThe devil being zapped is what created this world, the result of being zapped by God is that now the evil expressed by the devil coexist and is balanced by the good of God, it was God who zapped after all.\n\nGod zapped the devil because he was bad, but it wasn\u2019t his fault because God allowed for evil to exist in the first place, or at least the option for it.\n\nMeaning God is not fully omnipotent, because an omnipotent God would be able to allow the option of evil to exist AND make it such that evil is good. God cannot reconcile this difference evil has to be evil, it cannot be good.\n\nThat is why God must have mercy upon the devil. If God cannot even make evil good how can the devil be expected to do good?\n\nWho can straighten what God had made crooked?\n- Ecclesiastes 7:13\n\nGod cannot zap the devil too hard, for mercy, it\u2019s not completely the devil\u2019s fault so God trapped the evil of the devil in a world where it is \u201cgood\u201d. That\u2019s why after zapping the devil, the devil wasn\u2019t obliterated, but instead he gets life in prison to be rehabilitated.\n\nWhat better prison for the devil than a world that is good?\n\nFor it is necessary for a good world to exist precisely to house the evil of the devil, who else would have the devil over for tea? Certainly not a bad world.\n\nThe continued existence of suffering and death affirms to me how evil backwards is live, because evil is in the fundamental makeup in the fabric of reality itself, evil lives in us, balanced by the good of God, the world is meant to house the devil.\n\nWe know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one.\n- 1 John 5:19\n\nUltimately, suffering exist so that the devil could live. Again, if God cannot reconcile this then God is not omnipotent, if God is omnipotent and chooses to let us suffer then God is not truly benevolent.\n\nThe foundamental limit is that if you want a good God, then God cannot do everything, if you want a God who can do everything but does not, then that is a bad God.\n\nSo how could a good God continue to allow us to suffer?\n\nIf a shepherd has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray.\n- Matthew 18:10-14\n\nIn trying to save the devil, God deems it necessary to put us at risk again demonstrates God\u2019s limit at reconciling perfectly, the evil within.",

          "content": "Last year I very vividly saw a fat ugly black creature on little legs crawling through the corridor of my house. It was the most vivid kind of entity I\u2019ve ever experienced and I genuinely thought I had gone insane. I\u2019ve always been able to distinguish what is and isn\u2019t really there, but I\u2019ve had minor hallucinations along those lines throughout my life. In retrospect I notice these things I see come as a warning for bad things to come.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken about this in therapy and it\u2019s been mostly a \u2018keep an eye on it\u2019 kind of thing, but I haven\u2019t had symptoms consistent with any kind of disorder.\n\nWhat I found interesting was that a couple days ago the night before my session I had a dream that involved my therapist. I\u2019ve only had dreams of him in the therapy room and it would always be mimicking a session. This time, he was a regular person that I knew in the outside world and he appeared anxious and distressed. Something about him getting sick. \n\nI mentioned this in my session, and then while talking about a topic unrelated I saw something again in the space next to him. A dark figure that vanished as soon as attention was put on it. He noticed my expression changed and asked if I saw something. We talked about it a little and I asked him if he saw it too. I expected him to deflect with a question but after some hesitation he said he saw a flash of something. \n\nMy therapist is a trauma specialist and has expressed openness to the idea of things beyond science. I\u2019ve been seeing him for four years and he\u2019s been pretty unbiased and it\u2019s been difficult to infer what his beliefs are, and I was surprised by his lack of shock. He asked questions and made no implication that it wasn\u2019t real. When I told him that coupled with the dream I think it is a warning of some kind, he said he was taking me seriously.\n\nA part of me was anxious after the session because I was worried this might affect my therapeutic relationship. It almost felt like we were talking as regular people and our session even went overtime. I can\u2019t find any information of people who have had a similar situation and I don\u2019t know what to think of it. He\u2019s not been afraid to point things out as being possible projections of anxiety or an overactive imagination when I\u2019ve talked about seeing things before. I think he really did see something, and he believes me.\n\nRecently I asked for some sort of confirmation that I should pursue spirituality again. It\u2019s strange to have a figure of authority validate something that I\u2019ve been pushing away in my life. Especially one that I don\u2019t picture as being swayed by things that don\u2019t have concrete evidence behind them.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do with this. Am I in any sort of danger if I saw something again? Or am I just a messenger this time. And is this my confirmation that I should start involving myself in spiritual practice again?",

It almost crashed my browser.\n\nIn a nutshell: I had an experience that was either super-natural or psychotic. I gave equal air-time to both possibilities, and didn't find either particularly compelling. Discovered a third option which is that physical matter is not fundamental, and that there is a rational way to describe that concept, that also makes a lot of space for things that physical empiricism rules out. Also turns out physical empiricism rests on some assumptions which are logically flawed, resulting in circular reasoning etc.  \nI've since been reading books on physics, philosophy, emergent phenomena, and spirituality. I'm just scratching the surface, and this post is really just my own story to set the context, but I have probably 70k words of notes exploring things using this same fundamental idea, including physics, maths, mysticism and so on.\n\nI was pretty shook to post it - it's brutally open and makes me kinda vulnerable, but it is what it is.  \n\n\nLove.",

To give some context - I was an atheist but I became spiritual from last couple of years. I still have my doubts in existence of afterlife, heaven and hell. \n\nIn the dream, I mysteriously learned the exact day I would die. When that day arrived, I was with my cousins, engaging in light-hearted conversation and laughter, despite them knowing that it's my last day on Earth. Contrary to my expectations, I felt no pain as death approached. As my final moments arrived, I experienced the sensation of my soul departing from my body. On a whim, I requested my cousin to play a Pink Floyd song on his mobile. As the song getting started, my soul left my body. \n\nTo my surprise, I found myself in an afterlife, facing a wooden bridge that many souls were crossing. Some seemed very familiar with this path, as if they had traversed it before quite a few times, while others, like me, were in disbelief. Unsure of where to go, I followed the crowd. The bridge led to a staircase descending into a tunnel with a crossroad. The left path appeared to lead to hell, the right, to heaven. Despite our instincts, another first-timer and I chose the left path.\n\nA few steps in, signs proclaimed 'Hell is live now', and a movie was about to be screened, with many seated in anticipation. I spotted a friend, whom I don't particularly liked in real life, already seated (We both are very different people in real life and I made fun of him and he made fun of me. We are still friends due to our common friends). I asked him what the hell was going on here and why we are here.  He smiled and said he just saw his life's movie and now I am going to see mine. \n\nI woke up when movie was just getting started. That is all and now I am scared if all this really means anything or it's just a dream.",

So something maybe be considered not so good spirituality like getting angry, it's not a very good emotion to be out putting but everyone will have their moments of rage where it will come out naturally. I guess what I am trying to get at is, don't suppress your humanity. It's still a part of you in this physical realm. Take human experiences and use them as lessons. Example; You have been really clumsy one day and it's just been stressful, so you break down and beat yourself up. Ask what has been stressing you, ask why you have been so clumsy, ask why you are beating yourself up. We learn from our mistakes, take what happens as a lesson not as it's immediately something horrible",

It's all just fear mongering, government websites giving 'drugs are bad mkay' approach while completely neglecting the entire cultural/spiritual/medicinal component of psychedelics.  \nHonestly I'm a bit sick of this biased, 1 sided approach to articles on psychedelics.  \nAs I've really gotten to know these medicines, from experiencing some intense stuff like kundalini awakening, rebirth, ego death, and working with different types of shamans around the world, I've got plenty I want to share, and I know the life changing potential of these powerful medicines (as long as they're used correctly).  \nSo here's the link to the article. As always, I would love to hear suggestions, feedback, and ignite some conversation. The feedback of this community is always valuable. Let me know if you want more of this sort of stuff or not.  \nPlease feel free to share it with anyone who you think this information could help.  \nCheerios  \n[https://symbosity.com/bad-trip/](https://symbosity.com/bad-trip/)\n\n&#x200B;",

I had a dream that night (also another reason I got the black sage) I can\u2019t remember much from the dream, but what I can remember was how it ended. A family member was sleeping on my living room couch which I can believe has been sending me negative energy. I also thought I was very hot so I decided to turn the ac down. Apparently, the ac went down from 888 to 777 degrees. I was on the verge of waking up after this dream when I smelled a burning smell and I heard my fianc\u00e9 sit up and ask if something was burning which completely woke me up. We checked to see if anything was burning and concluded that there was no reason for the smell. I explained my dream to him and it really spooked him out. He was concerned as to why I reacted like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Happened to be 2:22 when I\u2019ve decided to ask  Reddit about this. Can anyone help clarify?",

          "content": "So this might sound goofy but I was wondering what this sounds like to anyone or any advice would be great.  \nI ended up moving away from home 4 years ago about an hour away to another state, I ended up getting a job at a small convenience store. A guy came in and I\u2019ve never seen him before, Instantly my heart melted, even seeing him made it feel like fireworks sparked in my head, heart and gut. He gave me a compliment and said he liked my pants (i was wearing black and white striped skinny jeans). I said thank you. He came in a couple times after that and I would blush everytime. We never really spoke too much after that but we would make googly eyes with each other. But I ended up quitting. Never seen him again. Fast forward to a year or so later\u2026 I have this bf and he gets a new job, he gets excited about how his boss is amazing. They\u2019re becoming good friends, saying how the 3 of us have a lot in common, and my bf even said me and him are so much alike it\u2019s weird. Well. I go into his job one day and low and behold\u2026 it\u2019s mysterious convenient store guy! We look at each other like deers in a head light but act like we never met. He knew things about me the way I knew things about him without having a face first because my bf would talk about me to him and vice versa. But every time we look at each other its like I\u2019ve known him for so long. I get the vibes he feels the same way by the way he looks at me. But he\u2019s so similar to the point we ended up having similar childhoods and ended up the same hospital 3 times, i went 3 times, he went 3 times, possibly around the same time as each other, i said I moved away from home an hour away to a different state, he came from the same state not too far away from me. We both grew up in the country, both listen to the same exact music, same interests, we want the same \u201cfuture\u201d. To us even looking alike! Blonde hair. Blue eyes. Certain face structures. Our styles even match. And what are the chances we possibly seen each other as kids, I see him when I was working and now end up moving out here in the same area and him befriending my bf? I see him a lot now and the longer he\u2019s around the more weird and intense it gets. We still barely talk tho despite him being friends with my bf. I feel like we both know the connection is that strong we don\u2019t want anything to happen? But I keep catching him looking at me into my eyes when I\u2019m not looking in a dreamy way. Like he knows me. Like he wants me. The first time i caught him looking at me he just kept staring into my eyes for like 5 seconds and I panicked and looked away. He ended up looking at me again recently in my eyes and when our eyes met he smiled this time but like it brought him satisfaction I guess you could say? Mixed with joy. He smiled like he was looking at me to get me to look at him. I also feel that we are in sync. Ever since all this has happened I\u2019ve also been seeing hella synchronized numbers. Especially 111, 1111, and 555. But also 222, 444. Can someone please tell me, am I crazy or is this meant to happen. There\u2019s been a few other times things have happened with him but I question it like is it him just being nice?? Or does he definitely see and feel it to? \ud83d\ude05. I question if its soulmate/twin flames ?  I also found out we both have life path 11. Im a leo sun, virgo moon, Aquarius rising. He\u2019s a libra, gemini, ??\u2026",

The current heaven is trialing us and judging us individually as a collective to where we are going to end up.

I downloaded this in the most vivid channeled dream this is the first thing I did is post here.\n\nWe are literally so depraved in comparison to heaven like even a single negative comment is baffling to them they\u2019re like how could you say that that\u2019s how pure they are now imagine what our actions and thoughts and beliefs and words are to them we\u2019re all sick compared to them, but they know this. The human race has a sickness and they\u2019re going to cleanse it.\n\nThe shift is coming the bibles telling of a new heaven and new earth is real but what they don\u2019t say is that hell will actually be created for those left behind it\u2019s so perverted and sexual and revolting it really was hell\u2026 please for the love of god and yourself please do what you can to get in touch with genuine repentance and genuine healing and genuine love because your soul does literally depend on it.\n\nThe shift is coming!!!!\nPrepare!!!!\nI love you all so, so much!!!!\n\nHurt people hurt people but just dig deep and search your soul and bring whatever you\u2019ve done and are doing to God or Christ and repent for it really feel the guilt and the remorse because deep down you genuinely aren\u2019t a bad soul :( I love you guys please take this seriously! \n\nThis is really happening.",

Just that the person and situation played a very large role in my life, and it was a big enough part of my life in terms of time, energy, connection, etc., for my assumption to be that this person was supposed to teach me a lesson, as most significant relationships are supposed to do. (Do I have this right so far?) A psychic actually picked up on the person three years before I met her, name and everything, which I feel would further validate this.\n\nBut some things happened that made me feel like meeting this person just brought me two steps back and one step forward in the life lessons I have learned and where I am headed on my spiritual path. I feel like anything I did learn from the situation once I was on the other side of it were just things that I actually already knew before the situation arose, and had just *un*learned during the situation becuase I thought that it was the right thing to do, then had to learn all over again when things took an unexpected turn. I don't think I came away with anything- in fact, I'm now just trying to re-access what I lost touch with when the situation misled me.\n\nThere are parts of me that were in pain before it happened, and I was trying to seek how to heal them and find a higher path and work towards what my soul wanted as a part of my life's mission. Instead, I just came out of the situation *more* confused and with *less* clarity, and also disheartened and hopeless. I honestly tried my best to do good and be loving and apply everything I had learned in my life up to that point, including what I had obtained from spiritual teachings and therapy and other psychological resources, and then came out on the other side struggling to maintain my spirituality because nothing made sense.\n\nI don't really want advice on what to do- I think I'm mostly just asking the question in the title but then ended up wanting to pour all of that out in the description. But from what I've read, my understanding is that we choose to reincarnate to learn certain lessons and that some of those lessons come to us in the people who play a significant role in our lives. I am stuck right now, because I am struggling to see what I was supposed to take away from this person and this situation. \n\nAre there any books or resources on understanding how all of that works? Or are there any meditations/exercises that could help bring me clarity on the matter? I feel like if I had a better understanding of the entire concept then I might be able to figure out how to approach it.",

Every now and then he\u2019ll say things that kind of creep me out, but I know it\u2019s just because he\u2019s dreaming.\n\nHowever the other night I was in a deep sleep and abruptly woke up to him shouting \u201cwhat is that?\u201d My eyes instantly opened the second after he finished saying that and I swear, I saw a huge circular shaped object floating above my head toward the window, and then it was gone. I can\u2019t wrap my head around whether I saw this for real, or if it was somehow part of my dream? But I really believe that I was fully conscious. This object was perfectly circular, very dark, very big, and slowly levitating towards the one window, which is a skylight, that we have in our room. I get scared verrry easily so this startled me. I felt extreme panic seeing this. My bf must have woken up because he agreed with me that he saw something there. The next day I asked him about it and I didn\u2019t mention any details so that I could hear what his perspective was before telling him mine. I literally gasped when he said he DID see something, and described it as a watermelon but shaded dark gray. I\u2019ve been wearing a sleep mask every night since then because I\u2019m freaked out. \n\nI\u2019m hoping someone can help me out here, give me some sort of possible explanation, and hopefully put my mind at ease.

I then realized the power of love where you are ready to drop all your limitations. \n\nLater when I restarted my career as a teacher, I once again grew as a mother when I tried to embrace all my students as my own children. So my inclusiveness has increased and my love has multiplied. \n\nI have observed my cousin who is a home maker and without her, all of my family members can't imagine our life. She creates an ambience where everyone's choices in food, daily routines is carefully accommodated and planned for the day.\nHer devotion towards family is amazing and thus helping her spiritual growth too. I am inspired by her in this aspect.\n\nOf all the days, when I have this sense of involvement and care towards everyone around me both at home and work place is the best day of my life. I go to bed with at most satisfaction on that day. I am trying to keep up this sense every day as much as I can though I keep falling back to older patterns of intolerance. \nAs Sadhguru said: \" The beauty of motherhood is not a certain\u00a0 capability but willingness to include\".\n\nThis sense of motherhood is a powerful process in my spiritual growth.

Usually, it wouldn\u2019t take too much for me to fall for someone, and also to become crippled by desire. This would result in them having a huge power over me. If they responded well and gave me attention, then I would be feeling high. If they would sometimes not show much interest, I would be feeling low. \n\nI\u2019m seeing so many people becoming crippled by love. We let our happiness depend on how someone else behaves. Maybe It\u2019s a deep-rooted condition that we feel constantly inadequate in our hearts, and we try to fill the gap with someone else\u2019s love and attention. And we have so many scars and wounds from previous experiences, because the truth is no one will ever truly keep up fulfilling our neediness. \n\nNow take this quote from the mystic Sadhguru: \n\"What most people call love today is little more than a mutual benefit scheme. Love is an unconditional sweetness of emotion.\" \n\nWhen we get together in relationships. will it not always be a kind of a transaction? I want certain things from my partner. Fx: I want to be looked at with sweet eyes, I want to be challenged emotionally and mentally, I want someone to share my deepest thoughts with, I want someone to go through life and dance with. Even if these things are happening in the most wonderful way, it is still a kind of transaction - Because we depend on someone else to fulfill those needs. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering, has it actually been possible for you to eliminate some of the neediness in your relationships? Like a mother would have love for her small child in a boundless and selfless way, could that kind of love be extended into our relationships, that we simply love our partner and let them be totally free? I have heard of people living in relationships without all the turmoil, and I wonder how it can be done.",

If there is no life energy within us, then we are dead, then there is nothing. The only thing that truly exists is this life energy which is us, but which we don\u2019t realize. We think that we are the body, we are the mind, when in reality we are the Spirit. Therefore, Spirituality is the study of the Spirit. It is being conscious of who we truly are. If we do not follow a life that is Spiritual or rather being that life energy, that Soul or the Atman, then we are living a life of illusion.\r  \n\r  \nWhat is a Spiritual life? A Spiritual life is all about realizing the Spirit, whether it is through meditation or by following a religion. Spirituality is awakening the truth about the Spirit. One may read Spiritual books, one may have a Guru, a Master, one may listen to audios, videos, or browse the net for information, but for one\u2019s Spiritual growth or evolution, one has to go on a quest or a search for Spiritual Enlightenment. One has to transcend the ego and the mind, because it is the ego and the mind that take us away from Spirituality.\r  \n\r  \nPeople don\u2019t know what Spiritualism is and why Spirituality is important, but they want to experience Spiritual awakening, they want to experience self-realization. We don\u2019t know who we are, where we came from and where we will go. We don\u2019t know who God is, where God is, what God is, but we know that God exists, that there is a power we call God. However, how many people really want to know God? How many of us are really making an attempt to know God? Yes, the world talks so much about positive thinking, Spirituality, Spiritual Enlightenment, but do we truly know the meaning of Spiritual Enlightenment?\r  \n\r  \n**What is Spiritual Enlightenment?**\n\n\r  \nSpiritual Enlightenment is the state of realization \u2013 when we realize we are not this body, we are not this mind, we are the divine Spirit, which is also the ultimate goal of life. This liberates us from suffering, from misery and pain. This liberates us from the cycle of death and rebirth, if ever there is. This whole world, this cosmos is nothing more than a cosmic drama. There are over 8 billion people on the stage we call earth, and we all come and go. However, we don\u2019t realize who is managing the show, who is the producer-director of this show.\r  \n\r  \nSpirituality will help us realize the truth. Therefore, we must bring Spirituality into our lives. Spirituality is the only solution to our unhappiness, it is critical for our well-being and peace. We are so caught in this world of illusions that we do not contemplate on the one thing that we must \u2013 the Spirit, the Life Energy, the Atman or the Soul!",

          "author": "monger123456689",
          "content": "Greetings.\n\nI am a person practicing the art of energy training. It is a means in which a person unlocks their psychic abilities.\n\nI would like to talk about how energy training is closely related to manifestation and how to connect one with the other.\n\nSo what is manifestation? Manifestation is a method in which you use intent to make what you want actually happen.\n\nHow does it relate to energy training? In energy training, like manifestation, we rely on intent heavily.\n\nThe difference is that we are actually working towards increasing our energy output instead of only using our energy to make something happen and we are also seeing in our mind our energy and feeling it\n\nWhy should I energy train if manifestation still works? Well, if you have a very low level energy (not used to feeling or moving your energy at all), it could take you months to manifest even the smallest thing.\n\nThis is where energy training comes in. From moving energy, you get many things:\n\nyour energy grows stronger leading to faster\n\nyou clear blockages in your body which are interfering with your manifestation\n\nyou become smarter and get a more vivid imagination which are useful\n\nNow that you know some of the benefits of energy training, I must explain some misconceptions and morality on manifestation and intent\n\n\"You manifest whatever happens to you\" This is only half true. If you keep asserting and wanting something bad to happen to you, your intent and the intent of negativity will win and it will happen.\n\nBut you do not actively create reality. That would make no sense, as you would be creating a way different world each time you intent something. Much like in dreams.\n\nIf you think something in a lucid dream it will happen. So in dreams you are actively creating your reality. But not in the real world (the matrix and its various dimensions)\n\n2. \"You must use your chakras to speed up manifestation\" You will achieve a much greater effect from having stronger energy than using your chakras to manifest.\n\nWhen you get strong enough to a point, the energy in the chakras will be less than the energy from your soul. (Primordial energy)\n\n3. \"You can manifest anything you want\" This is a bad thing. If you manifest something bad to happen to someone, it wil not only make your positive energy weaker, but you will start getting negative energy that will corrupt your soul.\n\nThis is why we have concepts like negative intent and positive intent.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, don't try to manifest something that relates to other people like manifesting your dream person or having your ex's car get towed. The other person did not know that you used magic to become their lover and it's very immoral.\n\nYou can still manifest things like someone's health getting better or a friend who is struggling with addiction coming clean. These are examples of using positive intent.\n\nSo.\n\nHow do you level up your energy? Well, I already made a post that explains many techniques of energy training. It's in my profile and on Soulnexus \"Explaining the techniques of energy training\"\n\nI am open to any discussion that relates to energy training or manifestation.\n\nCheers",

          "score": 5,
          "author": "Teeth_Less_Devil",
          "content": "Fear is the emotional reaction that results from a belief in a reality that is highly undesirable or extremely unfamiliar. This reaction is usually a consequence of an unwillingness to examine, inspect and explore a particular interaction or reality \u2013 between the individual and the environment. The unknown is considered frightening, not interesting. Therefore, any unknown causes the individual to put a given meaning of \u201crefusal\u201d to explore. Refusal to achieve a desired outcome or reality. That is, the individual gives up exploring the created outcome or reality, trusting in the belief that they are impossible. As long as there is no giving up on the intention to explore, there is no failure and defeat, or fear. In other words, laziness, the unwillingness to explore an interaction, leads to given meanings that predetermine an emotional response of belief in a reality that is highly undesirable\u2026\r  \n\r  \nThe state \u201cfear\u201d is useful when the individual recognizes that he has it and can reflect on this state. He then becomes a seeker of the cause \u2013 the filter or given meaning leading to this state. Thus, as soon as he discovers the cause that triggers it, he, while exploring that cause, changes the state, and the \u201cfear\u201d dissipates \u2013 it becomes something known and explored. The action of exploring a given state and interaction leads to knowledge of the relevant manifestation or reality. Then the very search for the unknown becomes an inspiration and an opportunity to explore. And the fact that this exploration is vast and inexhaustible causes excitement and trepidation, i.e. happiness.\n\nOnce you understand that it is okay to be afraid, you need to explore its nature and structure, to get to know it, to know what fear is. So you come to the conclusion that it is a messenger who knocks on your door and tells you:\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Hey, I have the desire to draw your attention and make you understand that you have beliefs that are opposite to the direction of the energy of your true self!\r  \n\r  \nLet\u2019s think for a minute: Actually, this is the essence of fear \u2013 energy turned against your true direction of existence, filtered through various beliefs and given meanings. When you filter your energy through beliefs that are in sync with your environment, you are devoted outward from yourself, experiencing joy, seeking filters to adapt to. So when you filter the same energy through beliefs that are not in sync with your parallel reality, you feel it as fear. Fear is an indicator of efforts and choices being made that will lead to results opposite to the desired. So we can take fear as advice from the Source that we are \u2013 what to change in the way we act. For example, to do it the opposite way we have decided it. Another option is to be grateful for the advice, i.e. to be grateful that we are being guided on exactly what to explore \u2013 the fear, the unknown that we will need to further solve the problem: \u201cThank you for drawing my attention to what I need to explore.\u201d\n\nThen the Fear stops hovering around you after it has done its job \u2013 it has directed your attention to something that you need to explore to have the desired result. The recognition of fear invalidates it. The known enemy is no longer an enemy. You know all its weaknesses, shortcomings, and above all \u2013 its way of thinking. This means that it is possible to use it. If it is not against you, then it is with you\u2026 If it was your enemy before, it suddenly becomes a friend who reminds you which things to pay attention to\u2026\r  \n\r  \nThe doorbell rings:\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Yes, who is it\u2026 ?\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 A notice from the fear that you need to sign.\r  \n\r  \nYou open the door.\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Hello, from the courier company \u201cFear\u201d we bring you a message about the belief that will bring you opposite results from the desired. Would you please read the message and sign that it has been delivered to you?\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Oh yes, of course. I read it. Where to sign\u2026 ?\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Here\u2026 Thank you!\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Thank you too! You are welcome any time you have similar information\u2026 I will be online!\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 Our company is at your service around the clock. Have a nice day.\r  \n\r  \nIn this way, fear becomes a friend and you use it according to its purpose \u2013 to draw your attention. If you don\u2019t listen and hear the messages, and the deliveries keep arriving, at some point the bill and the messages will pile up, and then fear will get your attention in a much more serious way \u2013 like a tornado that sweeps away your house and sometimes yourself. You just have to choose \u2013 to pretend to be deaf to the messages and not accept them or to accept them with a smile and take the time to examine them.",

When you\u2019re in a religion like that you tend to stay away from things that cause you financial issues (partying, hanging with the wrong crowd, drinking, etc etc) and mental stress. on the other hand, religion seems like it has sooooo many issues. blind faith, the worshiping of a human prophet instead of the one-ness that is within us all (God), the cult like vibe of it all. i\u2019m like...torn. i feel like i need to stay away from both sides in order to be successful. obviously, avoid the party\u2019s and toxic escapism bullshit but also avoid the cult like religions that tends to diminish your individualism and is a coping mechanism for most ppl. idk if this makes sense but thoughts?",

When the object merges in its cause, that merger is called pralaya or pran\u0301a\u0301sha [utter destruction]. Since the citta of the Macrocosm grows out of the Macrocosmic Aham, and the Macrocosmic Aham out of the Macrocosmic Mahat, when in pratisain\u032dcara\u2019s introversial movement the [unit] citta merges in the aham and the aham in the mahat, to call it pran\u0301a\u0301sha is quite logical and reasonable. The state of utter destruction of the citta and the aham and the state of all-pervasiveness of the mahat constitute sagun\u0301a\u0301sthiti [the state of transcendentality], or savikalpa sama\u0301dhi [the trance of determinate absorption].\n\nA\u0301tmani mahadpran\u0301a\u0301she nirgun\u0301a\u0301sthitih\nnirvikalpasama\u0301dhih va\u0301.\n\n[When the mahat merges into the A\u0301tman, it is called nirgun\u0301a\u0301sthiti (state of objectlessness) or nirvikalpa sama\u0301dhi (the trance of indeterminate absorption, or total suspension, of the mind)]\n\nPurport: The totally-absorbed state of the mahat, after merging that \u201cI\u201d feeling in the Citishakti [Cognitive Principle] \u2013 rather than doing the sa\u0301dhana\u0301 of installing the mahat in the Macrocosmic Mahat \u2013 is nirgun\u0301a\u0301sthiti [a state of objectlessness] or nirvikalpa sama\u0301dhi [the trance of indeterminate absorption, or total suspension, of the mind]. Due to the absence of any gun\u0301a, this state is called nirgun\u0301a\u0301sthiti, the state of objectlessness. This state is verbally inexpressible because\u2026\n\nTasyasthitih ama\u0301nasikes\u0301u.\n\n[This state (of nirvikalpa sama\u0301dhi) is beyond the mind.]\n\nPurport: This state of objectlessness being beyond the orbit of the mind, it is not mentally apprehensible.\n\nAbha\u0301vottara\u0301nandapratyaya\u0301lambaniirvrttih tasya prama\u0301n\u0301am.\n\n[The lingering bliss which follows this state of vacuity is the proof of that state, the means of firm belief in that state.]\n\nPurport: In the state of wakefulness all three stages of the mind, namely, conscious, subconscious and unconscious, remain active, but the subtler condition is inconspicuous due to the activeness of the cruder condition. While dreaming, the crude or conscious mind remains dormant, the subconscious and the unconscious minds remain active. During sleep, only the unconscious mind remains active. The opinion that the state of sleep is the state of the sense of vacuity is unacceptable to a subtle philosophical judgement, because at that time the works of both the conscious and the subconscious minds are done by the unconscious mind. The real state of vacuity is verily the state of utter destruction of the mind, and so even savikalpa sama\u0301dhi is not a state of vacuity. Only the state of nirvikalpa is the state of vacuity. In this state of absolute vacuity, the spiritual waves of exhilaration that fill the unit entity still continue to flow and trail on for some time even after that state of vacuity, that is, after the mind returns due to unserved sam\u0301ska\u0301ras [the consequential reactive momenta of one\u2019s past deeds]. These very trailing waves of exhilaration and joyous exuberance keep reminding the \u201cmindful\u201d sa\u0301dhaka [intuitional practitioner] that his or her \u201cmindless\u201d state had been one of absolute bliss.\n\n\u00c1nanda S\u00fatram",

          "content": "I had a dream that felt most familiar to me. I was making videos with my friends and they were fantastic. We were having so much fun. At some points I was one of the makers, at other points I was the viewers.\n\nBut at one point I attained lucidity and was watching them from my dream state. God was there and was telling me this was Heaven, and it existed side by side with this reality. \n\nAfter telling me that, I became one of the makers again and was watching this one video where I had given this woman creative authority and she had made her own music video with us. I remember watching it and not liking her that much, and then I woke up.\n\nAt first I was confused, frustrated, and sad. Those were beautiful times, and I was vaguely aware that they were taken from me, but God told me that that wasn't the point. The point of the dream, and why he showed it to me was because it was a hint. There was significance in the last video, and that's why I was here in this reality. But I could go back.\n\nAfter some thinking I realized I must've done something to her. Maybe I killed her out of spite, or maybe it was something as simple as telling her I didn't want her to be in our videos anymore. I made her feel like there was something wrong with her, or that she wasn't good enough.\n\nCoincidentally, that's what I've struggled with my whole life. Not only telling others they weren't good enough and cutting them out, but telling myself that as well. I always felt like I was inadequate, that there was something wrong with me or that people wouldn't like me. I realized that must've been my karma. I put those feelings on her, so now I struggled with those feelings too.\n\nIn this life and on my path to healing, I learned not to care what other people thought about me, not to care about fame or validation. I learned that I was special and built just the way God intended. So in that light, so was everyone else. Everyone has their place and the divine right to express themselves and be who God built us to be. \n\nI'm not saying this is the lesson we must all learn, but the hint was that WHAT I HAD STRUGGLED WITH THE MOST is what I put someone else through and that's why I'm here. God said I can go back whenever I want, I just had to learn this lesson. \n\nAnd because everyone is special and deserves a place in Heaven, I'm sharing this with all of you. You are all special and I want to see every single one of you when I get back to Heaven. Let's go together, and enjoy God's beautiful creation for all eternity. I was given a hint on how to get back, so now I'm sharing this hint too. No matter what you're all struggling with, we can go back. We WILL go back. \n\nWhat do you struggle with the most? What's been the biggest theme in your life? Consider maybe your lesson isn't only overcoming that in yourself, but overcoming it in others as well. Our karma is what brought us here, and we suffer as we have made others suffer. For me, the lesson was realizing everyone is special and has something valuable to offer. What's your lesson?",

I can\u2019t imagine this being a coincidence, there must be a deeper Meaning here? \n\nThe first death was in 2019, and right after the death I lost my voice for a full week (this event is actually what lead to turn towards spirituality & begin my journey). In 2021, a close family member of mine passed after 3 weeks of struggling in the hospital- i lost my voice the day after he died and was completely silent at his wake and funeral .. I remember bringing a notebook bc i had to write to communicate with others - and now, it dawned on me that here I am with no voice again, and that I lost it the evening of my cousins funeral. \n\nMy first thought is throat chakra .. could it be things left unsaid , or not fully expressing myself or allowing myself to grieve/ mourn?

Many of the symptoms and language barriers resolved over a few months, but I occasionally find myself having issues processing information and especially learning new things. I used to feel like I was pretty intelligent and now I feel dumb. But what has been frustrating is over the last year I\u2019ve had some major awakenings in my spiritual life - life changing experiences that have inspired new ways of living and things I want to learn about and grow and do, but often feel blocked by an inability to understand fully or retain information. Sometimes I feel incapable of even the smallest things. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure if I have a specific question. Maybe looking for others\u2019 experiences. Like did this happen for a reason to force me to slow down from my original busy career and mainstream life? Is there a purpose to any of this physical trauma? How can I overcome it, if it\u2019s something to overcome? Or maybe just how can I embrace it yet still immerse myself in a life that inspires me to learn and grow? \u2728",

I did some research and it seems that i stumbled upon the \"akashic records\" by accident. If someone were to tell me about this place state before it happened to me I never would have believed them. I could see the skin of the universe get pulled back and I could see the geometrical shapes that make up the universe I could see calculus and how the world works. I lived multiple separate time lines of life based off a certain choice point point in my life. I could see the probabilities of everything ever things never invented etc. The best way can explain it was saw the entire universe through the eyes of God for 45 minutes. I was amazed at the different things I saw and experienced. After this trip when I woke up it was like in the movies when everything is dark then they suddenly open their eyes and they're in the middle of the woods or something but I was on my couch lol. After opening my eyes I felt like everything is not how it was before, everything just seemed new like I was seeing the world from a different perspective.\nLater in the day just pondering what had happened I discovered that I could practically go to this place on command I felt like I could just match the wavelength just thinking about it. However my trips Since then I haven't been able to access nearly as much information. Can someone just kinda explain it to me i feel like I have nobody to relate with my friends are all calling me crazy. I just can't believ that a place so terrifingly beautiful exists. I just feel like the whole world is a simulation now.",

A coincidence? Even though I believe in coincidences, I find it all very strange. There may be a spiritual meaning behind this... They must have already disincarnated and are now in the spiritual world, they probably felt my enormous interest and despair and guided me to this photo from 1992?

I wrote it in the form of an argument/discussion, because it stemmed from one I had with my dad a couple years back and only just formed a solid argument for it. Lmk what you think. \n\n- Time is not a constant. It is experienced by everyone differently. \n- No, it\u2019s the same. A second is a second no matter what\u2014see a timer. \n- But a second is longer for someone under stress typically. When you\u2019re having sex, a second is gone like it didn\u2019t even come at all\u2014you\u2019re experiencing pure ecstasy. \n- But, the timer says it\u2019s constant. Someone having sex for 20 minutes that feels like no more than 5 is still experiencing the same 20 minutes as a person that is studying who feels that it was no shorter than an hour. \n- Yes, but if each person feels like time is different\u2014if the perception of the duration of time is contingent on the person\u2014is time as we know it, as we see it pass in on a clock, not only guidelines? Our perception is what\u2019s true. For example, you and your friend are working on a group project together. You and he are both researching, but you are being extra productive. You\u2019re finding with ease the articles that best fit the Project. Things are going well for you. Whereas for him, he\u2019s lost. He\u2019s trying to figure out where to find articles. Neither of you have a clock or phone nearby. At the end of the two hours that you both cut out of your days to meet and work on the project, you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s over already, \u201cit felt like 30 minutes,\u201d you exclaim. Whereas he felt as if it lasted 3 or 4 hours. Both of you had the same experience, sitting next to each other. One was going with the flow of time, and one was going against it, fighting its constant current. Thus, only your perception is important\u2014what does it mean to objectively last 2 hours when 2 hours for one person feels longer than 2 hours for the other person. I\u2019m not saying to label the amount of time spent based on how long you felt it last. I\u2019m simply saying time as we know it is contingent on our perception. It is not as constant as we think. My perception of not only time but also of the world is completely different from yours and ours from anyone else\u2019s. Once you realize this it becomes easier to accept that time and many other aspects pass differently. This can be applied to a bigger scale\u2014the older people grow, the faster time passes. Thus, sure time as on a clock is the same, the perception is what we know and it is the only way we can experience it. This, that is what\u2019s important to the individual. I believe we think of time incorrectly. We think of it in a limited space. We put it in a box and haven\u2019t questioned it since. But there\u2019s more to understand about the passage of time I believe.",

If yes, how does it occur in the first place and what does the treatment look like?\n\nAfter plenty of research on this topic and encountering some really difficult people who suffer from Narcissistic Personality Disorder and similar, I arrived at a conclusion that they're possesed by demonic spirits. And I'm not alone to arrive at this conclusion, there are countless experts who agree. Not just that, there are even some ancient references to it that fit the description.\n\nNarcissists know they're doing wrong and derive sadistic pleasure from hurting kind hearted people. There's an utter lack of empathy and self awareness, and complete inner disbelief in a higher self.\n\nVery rarely, they feel the need for seeking help with their destructive behaviours, but they also desperately want to attack the same person that comes to help them, because of the strong assumption that they can't be wrong. If you want to propose the trauma angle to explain their behaviour, there's hardly any success with therapy, and in the extremely rare event that they agree to try it, they never miss this golden opportunity to traumatize and gaslight the victim further. \n\nThey're as close to the manifestations of evil in human form as we can get. In fact, in the field of psychology, Narcissism, Machiavellinism and Psychopathy forms the Dark Triad. These people would love to destroy you and won't bat an eye before going out to get their next victim.\n\nOf course, most here will say, \"look at the divine in them\". I tried. I really did. Even most holy saints in the history did. You know what happened? I hope you do. The story never ends well. Not a very good idea! Let's learn from it.\n\nSo, is there a cure for spiritual diseases like these? If yes, how does it occur in the first place and what does the treatment look like?",

          "content": "I want to share a story and just hear others thoughts and insight, and if anyone has had a similar experience. \n\nLast night I was opening up to my partner about some of my recent insights and spiritual experiences. A lot of what I was telling him, I had never said out loud or even put directly into words so it was the first time I was piecing together some of these things in a more tangible way. Anyway, I started talking about an experience where I felt in complete alignment with my higher self (for context, I have been in conversation with my HS for a couple years) and had this moment where I felt as if my HS, for the first time, was directly communicating back with me. I felt like I was lifted up and merged into this one high state of being rather than being a separate consciousness below my higher self. I could sense how this consciousness watches over me and the love it has for me. It felt like an embrace and a deep knowing that she (myself) is here to protect and guide me and all that. It felt wonderful and insightful\u2026 then just a couple months ago, I had a similar experience with Mother Gaia. I have also been in conversation with her regularly for some time and one night, it felt like she came directly to me and showed herself. Not visually, but I could feel her presence and she basically let me know that she is here as my protector and will also serve as a guide to me. It felt like this wave of blissful, peaceful knowing that washed over me and illuminated me from the inside out. That was a magical moment as well and I felt this beautiful emotion that I had never experienced before. Anyway, I pretty much have just carried those experiences with me since then.\n\nIn the last couple weeks I have felt like my spiritual journey is on the cusp of a big breakthrough and a flood of insight. I was talking to my partner about some of it but had no intention of telling him I have been visited by or interacted with my higher self and Mother Gaia because there are some things I guess I\u2019m just not ready to say out loud yet, or haven\u2019t even fully grasped myself yet. But before I knew it, this wave came over me and I was telling him the exact stories of what happened. While I was telling him, I felt like I was out of it and almost like I was drunk or high. Just a buzzy out of it feeling. It felt like I was listening to someone else tell him this story while I was just sitting there like I wasn\u2019t ready to talk about that??? I could hear myself saying these things but in my mind I was also like why am I saying this right now, where is this coming from? I told both stories start to finish and had tears streaming down my face as I did. The moment I finished, I looked at him and just said \u201cI feel like I need to cry\u201d and then just started bawling my eyes out for a couple minutes. He came over to me and just let me cry it out with him. It felt like that cry was just a direct way for some energy to exit my body and once it was gone I just started laughing for a second and then I looked at him and was like \u201cI have no idea what just happened, I have no idea where any of that came from.\u201d And that was it. Afterwards I felt kind of shaken up but not in a bad way, kind of just like I had just done something really intense and that required a lot of exertion. \nThoughts?",

I don't want to go into details, who knows this case will know, who doesn't know - don't look it up. I cry general tears for her which is pointless since she's long dead and nothing bad is happening to her anymore. But what am i supposed to believe in here ? The soul chose it? I haven't even read the full list she had to experience and im already sick and devastated, but to choose this ? Some people even say it's karma or past life build up. But i don't see it as something fair at all. She was just a kid, why would a kid suffer for past mistakes, it doesn't make sense so I ain't buying that karma stuff. It's the same all-present question about \"good\" and \"bad\" things happening to the people. \"Just to experience it\" it's so brutal, life is so bruta.  \n\n\n There maybe some higher order i can't comprehend with my mind yet but i would still say it's brutal. I'm not even mad at people that did this, but at the situation in whole. How can world that has nebulas, galaxies and stars can have this. We essentially live on this planet and we have to kill other animals for food. This is very brutal but a way of life and Junko's story is part of this life too. But I personally don't have enough emotional experience to process it and come to any resolution. I don't even want explanation for evil, i would want explanation for brutality. Where it comes from, why it happens. It wasn't for survival for sure. Animals don't do tortures, they don't take pleasure in victim's pain. Is it same brutality as black holes eating off entire galaxies without caring, demolishing all the light. But it's not the same since they don't experience emotions, they don't feel pain. Then why the (excuse my language) FUK WE DO THIS ? There's no answer to that. I hope ultimately the love will shine through.",

There is no mind and ego ME, there will be no karma, there will be no rebirth. Therefore, the mind confuses us. It creates confusion so we don't reach the conclusion. And death remains a mystery. So, we see through history, and we just live and die and we are reborn and this goes on and on. No doubt death happens to everyone. But the mind creates such an illusion about death, that we think that we die, when in reality we are immortal Souls.",

          "author": "lilyd322",
          "content": "I believe the way most situations play out is that there\u2019s a reason behind them, but you don\u2019t know why until you\u2019ve gone through the pain of it (excluding abuse, etc.) for example, a heartbreak, or a rejection.\n\nI\u2019m going through a situation and I don\u2019t know what to make of it and I wanted to know if there\u2019s any sort of spiritual connotation to it.\n\n\n**BACKSTORY:**\n\nI met a man 2.5 years ago in the city I used to live in. We went on a couple dates and I was smitten. He was there a few weeks but going back to the country where he lives (where I have family, but I hadn\u2019t visited in a while). 1.5 year later, I ended up moving back to the country, and we reconnected as friends. He was the one who reached out. I didn\u2019t move because of him, life just somehow led me there. I had resigned from my job and I wanted to be closer to my family.\n\nI had always admired him but it didn\u2019t seem like he wanted anything more and so we hung out as friends. He did casually ask me to hang out together on New Year\u2019s last December but at that time I had already met someone so I said no. Anyway a few months later (when it had been a while since my other connection ended) we rekindled again and talked more and more, ended up in a romantic connection, during that time he became more emotionally available, opened up, and we even briefly talked one night about how strange it is that we met in another country and now live in the same one and how it felt like fate. Even the people we know, it\u2019s seriously strange and unlikely that we\u2019d have this mutual connection but we found out that his best friend and my brother were really good friends and basically my family trusted him even more due to this mutual family friend. Everything literally just felt like a destined \u201csmall world moment.\u201d\n\nBut he was still on his journey to figure out his own life and couldn\u2019t give me what I needed emotionally, so we parted ways. He\u2019s going through a lot of family situations too, so I understand, and my intuition says he cares about me and he knows how I feel too because I reached out to him, but he has a massive wall up. I\u2019m not forcing the wall down and I have surrendered but this is my question\u2026\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\nWhat is this journey for? Why do we meet people who we potentially fall in love with only to end up not even being able to be together because of wrong timing? It was wrong time timing 2.5 years ago, it was wrong timing a year ago, and it was wrong timing again a few months ago.\n\nI know sometimes these experiences don\u2019t have \u201cwhy\u2019s\u201d but it\u2019s been driving me crazy to want an explanation because I think it\u2019ll make me feel better if I had an explanation as to why some things feel like they\u2019re made for you and then you can\u2019t even have them. You know?\n\nCan anyone relate to the feeling of just being lost over a similar situation, wondering why, and trying to make sense of the journey?",

You got a drink and started talking to someone at the bar that has your dream job. You leave the bar with an interview for your dream job the next day. You. You made that happen. Not because of divine intervention. Because you just decided to go to a bar. Because the guy working there happen to play a song on the speaker. Because that company with your dream job happen to be hiring.   \nThe reason for you standing where you are right this moment is because of all your decisions and behavior since you were born.   \nThe reason for all the bad and all the good is just you. Youre decisions on the most miniscule if things have a lasting impact on the world.   \nIsn\u2019t that easy enough to grasp? Why are people so desperate to give meaning to everything?

He told me how precious our relation is to him, but that he had no romantic feelings for me, nor that we ever would be a couple. \n\nMy intuition tells me that we will end up together, but my rational side should understand \"move on for ever\". My intuition was usually so strong that I find it hard to be rational. \n\nYou've been in a similar situation? How do you handle this? Is this even my intuition or just an attachement issue?",

But it's also because I still struggle a lot of my Self-Agency, discipline and many ego-centrist issues.\n\nI'm 24 btw, I see my friends and colleagues succeeding in their careers, working hard on their long term goals and relationships. And I'm feeling stuck, materially. Feeling a little too comfortable with just being like a still plant, making enough money to just pay my rent and eat and it's kinda scary because I'm aware of how I'm gaslighting myself into believing it's part of the process, but I'm stagnant it feels like prison and I'm definitely not living at my highest passion. I'm also procrastinating career decisions I need to make as soon as possible, but I kinda don't care enough. For me reading about psychology, esoterism and quantum physics feels good but also this focus on \"self-improvement\" now is feeling like a scape or a burden.\n\nI need to bring me back to society's demands but I don't really seem to care if I don't come back.

          "content": "For my part, so far, I have not found any. None more than \"the sensation\" of deciding my actions, but the sensation is not falsifiable, nor is it totally objective, that is, it can make us believe that the sun revolves around the earth. EDIT: Well actually I remember one, which I don't know if it's an argument: Qualia.\n\nSCIENTIFIC DETERMINISM: Current science tells us of a beginning, at least of this universe, of a great 'explosion' or expansion, which we can call the first cause (at least of this universe). Cause of the progressive development of light, stars, matter. A chain of events, cause-consequence, similar to a game of billiards. And therefore it is a cause-effect chain of energy and matter (phenomena widely studied by classical physics), if we could know the exact speed and location of billiard ball 1 (continuing with the analogy) impacting ball 2, which will cause The resulting speed of the total number of balls being moved by chain impacts, and the final resulting result of the location of all the balls in space, we could know the entire cause-effect and result chain of everything in the universe. Therefore, all the information about the course and result of ball 2 (present) was in ball 1 (past), everything would already be written, there would be no other margin, everything within the plans of the whole, including emotions, decisions, and emotions. that dictate decisions.Because our decisions derive from the conditions and cause (cause-consequence) of neurotransmitters in our brain, which derives from our body, which derives from some environmental conditions that have occurred, which derive from the development of matter in the stars given the first cause.\n\nNeither could quantum physics: Nor could quantum physics throw a definitive rope to those of us who seek a light of freedom. It is true that from the quantum approach the exact speed and location of a particle cannot be known at the same time (uncertainty principle). Further studying the most elementary so far, the wave, this also turns out to be deterministic.\n\nTHE ARGUMENT FROM NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES: Cases have been reported where the patient who does not have cardiac activity recorded, and with partial brain activity, manages to know the location and details of who and what is in his room, without this being conscious. This could be understood as a strong argument, or refutation of materialism. The mind or soul would not be exclusively linked to the brain, matter. But, (and this is a personal deduction) if we observe photographs of the aura in people or things, we would have a manifestation of what our emotions and thought process would look like, which constitutes the soul. Therefore, if person A is at a point in space 1, his aura or soul cannot be in space 2. From this I can draw a first conclusion, that the soul is matter, subtle. It is subtle matter located in time and space, in another state.Personal refutation: I am not an atheist and I believe that we all have soul and spirit, and that these make up, are part of BEING in capital letters or THE WHOLE, just like the leaf of a tree, the tree in its entirety. What happens is that this tree is also made up of a material dimension (multiverse/s), and a spiritual or soulful dimension. And since the soul is subtle matter... the disembodied, the soul about to leave the body... goes towards the subtle, the soulic dimension of the ALL, of the tree. In the material dimension, just as a leaf falls to the ground when it perishes to nourish the soil, the soul would ascend to nourish the clouds that provide irrigation to the tree. Being in lowercase letters experiences part of the dimensions of BEING in uppercase letters. The tree being part of a greater whole that is still material. In conclusion: upon disincarnation, our subtle matter ascends to its port, the subtle matter part of the BEING. Like a cell that breaks down and forms the being in the extracellular matrix of a person.\n\nMy personal ray of light:\n\nAnd yes, I have to refer to the feeling, although as I said I don't know if it is a final argument. To the feeling of being alive, the conscious experience of seeing the flower in an adagio. I could never know exactly what an astronaut feels when seeing the Earth from the stratosphere, even if he took all the time to explain it to me. A picture would say a thousand words. Nor could a person, who lived his entire life in a black and white room, perceive the color blue, even if he strives to understand it and studies it theoretically. Blue is 'qualia'.\n\nBut:...but... This raises a division between feeling and knowledge. ...But... What if feeling is a format of knowledge?Because I feel like it's cold, I know I should put on a coat. Or because I know it's cold, I feel like I should put on a coat to feel comfortable. Inside the black and white room, an alien could give us ALL the 'knowledge', in all its formats, and make us experience the color red without leaving the room. THE matrix would continue to be matrix, the sensations: knowable......\n\nayudasdasd",

So I asked him about it. After talking to him, there was this phase where he'd stare at me and I'd know he's looking at me and again when I looked at him, and move my gaze, he'd still look at me. Before we started talking, I felt as if he's been observing me cuz there were moments where in I felt him being close or in proximity to me. Not because he wanted to, but cause of the situations around us. After we spoke, he was intuitive enough to find that I've anxiety issues and he told me a lil bit about his past. He helped me with studies and he asked my help in meditation. So, I've been helping him with meditation and with spirituality and his mental health for 5 months now almost. He's going through a heartbreak. And I've been helping him through that as well. Cause when I got to know about what's he's been through, I kept my feelings aside and just wanted to be there for him. No matter whatever happened. There was this part in me which wanted to protect him at all costs from everything negative. Sometimes I feel as if maybe me and him have a soul contract or not. Cause there have been moments where we couldn't see each other. It's been 4 months since I saw him. My friends saw him but I didn't. Maybe it happened cuz the timing never aligned. Or maybe the universe never wanted us to see each other. Today he was in my college and I was there too but I never got to see him. He told me about it once I was back in my home. Is this a universe's way of saying that it's not meant to happen? \n\nPS:  I was thinking of giving him an evil eye bracelet, since he's leaving on the weekend.",

          "author": "intwined",
          "content": "**THIS IS A LONG READ!!!**\n\nI know the answer to this. I just want to share my story for those who may want to hear it. This is a long read about a coincidence I experienced that I know most would look at as a sign. I don\u2019t look at it that way since I know of all the \u201cprepwork\u201d it took to get there. Regardless, I feel this story may resonate with someone and/or teach them something or help them understand something about themselves, which is enough for me to post it. \n\n**Background: The Setup**\nEach variable here must be EXACTLY AS IS or else everything else is ruined. If you don\u2019t understand the butterfly effect, just do a quick google search.\n\nBack in August during a hypomaniac episode (therefore I need to have bipolar II), I impulsively got myself into college. The stars really aligned for that, which is its own story, but not the point. \n\nBack in May? I started smoking weed. I always buy off my friend who lives a good bit away (therefore he had to have moved out) usually after work at night (solely because I had my job).\n\nAbout a month or two ago, I quit putting $30 of gas in my car every week and just decided to do $10 as needed every few days.\n\nAbout a week ago, I had a mental breakdown as I realized I had ruined my life with college. I did in fact still hate college as much as I did last year and had absolutely no interest in my degree, on top of the fact that because I did no work I was forced to drop out. The worst part was that I lied to my parents the entire time (therefore I had to be lying the entire time), telling them I loved it and was on top of everything. Realizing my life is now \u2018live a lie\u2019 or \u2018confess and face being kicked out\u2019, I lied in bed that night and after crying for the first time in forever, I said \u201cjust give me one clear sign about what to do next\u201d (therefore I had to ask for this or else I may not have perceived the coincidence as so coincidental). What I was really asking the Universe was: college or my passion?\n\nSo, let\u2019s go back to a few days ago, the day after my mental breakdown.\n\nTwo days earlier, I get low on weed (therefore I had to be proactive about my weed stash which I\u2019m usually not) so I tell my friend I\u2019ll need some soon. He says he\u2019ll pick up the next day (Wednesday) but doesn\u2019t end up texting me back (and I don\u2019t either, which is unusual of me). I don\u2019t go until Thursday (therefore he has to have it ready the next day).\n\nAbout two weeks ago, one of my coworkers realized I\u2019m a pushover and can use me for car rides home every night (therefore he needs to work with us, during my shifts, for the same hours, have no car, be my friend, and know I\u2019ll take him home). He asked for one that Thursday night, so I wait an hour for him. Actually, I didn\u2019t have a plan, I was just kinda sitting there, then after about an hour I was like \u201calright bruh you\u2019re walking home\u201d and left. This is actually atypical because (1) he usually doesn\u2019t take an hour and (2) I usually don\u2019t wait an hour for someone. So, I start heading to my friend.\n\nI needed gas! I had procrastinated getting gas (like I always do). I also have a really bad habit of hating making stops when driving, so I tell myself I\u2019ll only hit up a gas station on my right on the way up, that way it\u2019s as fluent as possible. There\u2019s only 2 of these I can go to before I\u2019d have to make a u-turn to get to my friend.\n\nI pass the one I said I\u2019d go to and for some reason, at the very last second, decide not to (therefore I now only have one choice left)\u2014 probably because I knew there was another ahead. Despite the fact that I knew that the one ahead would inconveniently change my route, I went anyways.\n\nSo, I get there. Almost every spot is open, I hesitate to pick one. I choose one (had to be this specific one), get gas, yadda yadda. I think I decided to get $15 of gas instead of my usual $10/$12. This is important because it made me stay those few extra seconds that allowed the guy to get out of his car before I shut my door.\n\nAs I\u2019m leaving, a car pulls up behind me. He gets out of his car and says \u201chey young man\u201d. Me, who has been \u201chassled\u201d like this before thrice thought to myself \u201cjesus i just want to go get my weed please leave me alone\u201d.\n\nNow, let\u2019s make something clear. He starts the conversation asking for money. He wants gas, I understand, but I don\u2019t have any cash on me, and \u201csir look how little I put in my own car\u201d. There\u2019s a little truth to that but mostly I just want to get away before I\u2019m trapped in a moral dilemma. Anyways, point is that **I\u2019m pretty confident the guy just wanted money and when I said no he had to come up with something else to talk to me about so I didn\u2019t think he was a beggar.** This is fine\u2014 I wasn\u2019t going to think that anyways\u2014but it is kind of annoying, because it\u2019s already 10:40 PM and I WANT MY WEED!\n\n**The Coincidence**\nFinally, it gets weird. Again, **I fully understand he\u2019s just trying to make convo, likely to soften me into compromising into giving him some money,** but it gets really weird. He asks if I have a job, what I do, am I in college\u2014 which is kinda weird to me to ask someone at the gas station as they\u2019re obviously trying to leave but oh well. I tell him I\u2019m not in college since I just set in stone my plan to drop out the night earlier. **He says that God told him to tell him to tell me to go specifically MY college\u2019s financial center to help me out.** Now, realistically, he tells me to do this because (A) I\u2019m a busboy, which I told him, (B) I have no money to give him, (C) I put so little money in my own car that I told him was \u201cvery good on gas\u201d, and (D) I think I told him college was too expensive. **So, whilst it is weird what he said, it\u2019s pretty obvious why he said it and how far the reason is from what I was looking for.** He also said something about \u201cnot listening to my friends\u201d, which I do largely agree with, however one of my friends just a few days earlier jokingly said \u201cyou should drop out and become a full time <my passion>\u201d and I was like \u2018ah you don\u2019t say\u2019.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s it. I still didn\u2019t listen to him, and maybe therefore the universe. I think I have lots of bad karma on the way for that, but I also hope that the\u2014if it was a sign\u2014 that the universe knew I was never going to back to college and just sent that guy as a way to solidify my decision.\n\nI am usually all for \u201cit\u2019s just the butterfly effect bro\u201d, but there are so many variables in play here that had to be so precise for this event to happen: not just in my life, but theirs\u2019 (my friend, the coworker, and the gas station guy) too. With ANY slight change, it wouldn\u2019t have happened.\n\nI could probably say something about free will here too but you\u2019ve read enough.",

However, the general consensus would be insanity or lies.

You risk ridicule and punishment. You may end up locked up in a padded room or behind bars. Historically, it seems this has always been the case. Think witch trials or countless reports in biblical text of what happens when people believe in witnessed gnostic accounts that do not fit the script of those days. \n\nTaking all this into consideration, we can see that people in the past took risks to spread whatever word was received.

Therefore, there's no question of whether there is karma or not. Spiritually, when we realize we are not the doer of karma, then we are liberated from karma. We are liberated from the cycle of suffering and sorrow. There will be no tomorrow because we will be united with the Divine. This happens when we realize we are the Soul, the Spark of Unique Life and we are not the doer of actions. We do not own any action, any karma.",

You're not the ego that create the agony of anger, hate, revenge and jealousy. Therefore, when you're enlightened, the body will be hungry, but you don't suffer the body may fall sick or get tired, but you are peaceful. Generally you will sleep well because your mind is under your control. Your social interactions will be in a new state because you're free from all attachments and relationships.

I didn\u2019t know whether these things were good or bad at that time and because I trusted them because they were my family I would go and do those acts with them. I\u2019m ashamed to say that because it was so repeated over years, I started getting addicted to it. Not necessarily porn but pleasing myself. At a very young age. I hate that I had to be introduced to these things at that age and suffer a terrible fate at the hands of someone I truly care about till this day. He was also very young at the time to which I\u2019m surprised he even knew about these things like that at that age. So because he was also pretty young I don\u2019t hold a grudge and because I\u2019m very close with him. I still love him and care about him and would never want him to suffer anything for it because he didn\u2019t know what he was doing was wrong too. I had another family member once walk in on it and just stood there shocked but never said anything about it or paged them. Because I\u2019m still kinda addicted to the act of pleasing myself, will I suffer by being reborn here in my next life. I\u2019m a Hindu and I know lust is a huge sin and I really wish this hadn\u2019t happened to me. I didn\u2019t know this was considered trauma until I told a friend of mine today and she looked at me in shock and started crying about how disturbing my childhood was. Please someone tell me how I can get rid of this addiction and if I will have to suffer a karma for having this addiction. I don\u2019t enjoy having lustful thoughts at time and it disgusts me at times even but sometimes it just hard for me to not think like that.",

I should preface this by saying I am no stranger to casual dating/online dating, and have been in a handful of long and short relationships. That is to say, I have a good idea of how I generally feel when i meet someone/in the beginning of a relationship. \n\n\nI went on a date with this guy on tinder, and right from the start things were kind of\u2026 weird? As soon as I matched with him I immediately just felt super drawn to him. He had literally  nothing about himself in his profile, and quite honestly really cringey/unattractive pictures of himself, so i had no idea why I felt drawn to him. He didn\u2019t even try to have a conversation with me, just asked me out on a date, and then proceeded to cancel that first date 3 times at the last minute. I say all this to give context to how weird it was that I felt so drawn to this dude. I had tons of other (better seeming) guys asking me out, but immediately wanted nothing to do with them. \n\n\nWe did have a date eventually, and it ended up being an amazing night. We had everything in common with me, he was seriously like the boy version of me. We just immediately connected and ended up talking for 9 hours, and he kept talking about when we could go on our next date, how much he liked me, and things he wanted to do with me. It sounds silly, but i have never had an experience like that with someone before. He texted me the next day to ask me out on a second date, but like before he would initiate plans with me just to cancel at the last second, saying he wasn\u2019t handling the stress of school well ( it was midterms, and he\u2019s in the program at our uni known for being the hardest in the country, so i was willing to cut him slack). Ultimately, he ghosted me by standing me up for a dinner date he had planned. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been weeks and i can\u2019t stop thinking about him, even though i know what he did was shitty   . I\u2019m just so confused about the pull i felt to him, and why the universe would put a connection like that in my life just for one night. Any insight or advice on this? thank you",

And I also know that tarot readers (some) may say what you want to hear for their own benefit whether it be money or recognition. But hear me out on this because I need advice..\n\nSo growing up I\u2019ve always felt a strong connection to people, music, frequencies, animals, etc.. you name it. I joined a livestream a few weeks ago and at first for about 45 minutes didn\u2019t say anything just watched different people\u2019s readings go about. I decided to ask for one because I felt the vibe was genuine from the reader and their audience. \n\nImmediately the reader said when they saw my name they felt a strong presence almost similar to that of a spirit guide. Which obviously I know as a human in this form I cannot be. But the reader was in a sense \u201cstarstruck\u201d (idk how else to word it). \n\nI consider myself to be an empathetic and pretty passionate person but I don\u2019t personally do readings or anything like that. Just am always the person people connect with off bat or come to advice for. Id like to think im very nurturing and compassionate with a big heart.\n\nI guess im asking if there\u2019s a term for this stance that I have in life? Is it just an over abundance of positive energy? Or is there a term for it?\n\nI\u2019ve always felt like I have more abilities than others in the sense of vibes and frequencies but dont know how to pin point it.",

Maybe it's a lesson, cuz they all said same thing about me either beeing too kind, too naive or im just straight dumb and slow to work. Idk what kind of lesson i should learn here, but i wouldn't want to attract that anymore, cuz it'll get more ridiculous if i get fired for 5th time. Maybe I'm not moving on the right track im supposed to, but i have no idea what's my place and finding out is such a painful process because i still need money to survive in this world.   \n\nAnyway want to hear ur thoughts, cheers",

I also now see shapes and very trippy designs but it\u2019s hidden behind the smoke so I\u2019ll see it only faintly, what does that mean? Also Last time I cried a lot, the smoke went away and I saw my body but it didn\u2019t have the face but had the head, I was more built and had dreads it seemed like and they were outlined blue. Now that before I could experience and experiment with it, I went through some trauma and the smoke came back, what is the meaning of crying to get the smoke to go away and the person staring back at me when I close my eyes?

Can you tell me more about this?\n\nANSWER: Every soul on the planet is split into many parts, yet you see yourselves as singular, linear individuals. Therefore, what you were told is accurate metaphysically and interdimensionally. Know this: You are also many parts, some of whom are on the other side of the veil, and some of whom actually reside with other Humans on this planet as guides.\n\nThis is the most complex thing we have ever told you, and we have broached this very issue many times. So don't be surprised if you find the information has morphed its way into some kind of simple singular explanation. It isn't simple, and it's not understandable as long as you consider yourselves \"one.\"\n\nEditor's note: Please see \"Group Energy\" on the alphabetical Q&A Index. Also, here's a reference to what Kryon is speaking of: [http://kryon.com/inspiritmag/archives/Q-A%20archives/2004-Q%26A/Q%26A-1rstquarter04.html#48]\n\nYup.",

          "content": "My mom has several different stories of seeing/interacting with a blue ball of light.\n\nShe claims growing up, she would sleep over at her grandmothers house (who was very spiritually connected and lived in a very very old Brooklyn brownstone) and at night sometimes a blue orb of light would slowly drift into her bedroom and hover near her bed. She was scared of it and would hide under the covers until it would eventually go back out the room. \n\nThis story is actually my sisters experience- She once was dating someone who lived in their grandparents house after they died, and claimed their grandparents were still very present. My sister had many paranormal experiences here but one strange one was that once she woke up in the middle of the night to a large man wearing tribal type clothing and of island or Polynesian descent (not related to said partner) who had several blue orbs of light that he was swirling around in his hands.\n\nThe final experience is that my mom once couldn\u2019t sleep in the middle of the night and drove to a nearby park on a lake. This park had a historical protected graveyard off to the side of the lake near some overgrown brush. It was pitch black and after a few minutes she noticed a tiny blue light that she thought was maybe a boat or something. But then she noticed it was slowly getting bigger and brighter and that it was on the waters edge. Eventually it was a baseball sized glowing blue orb. My mom suddenly felt a very powerful and visceral feeling of anger, hatred, fear, pain etc. and she floored it out of the park.\n\n\nAre these just spirits? Is this a specific spiritual phenomenon? Why do some spirits manifest this way?",

Many people dont, many infants die in first months. Back in the day people had more children so only those strong enough would survive. Same goes for other animals.\n\n Since we artifically increased our survival rate, which still is not available for many, universe doesnt care about your survival. So it is question about nature of life itself. It tries to survive, all cells in your body try to keep you alive. Survival everyday, you could die any moment if something in your body would refuse to go right. With these things in mind i think that talking about nature of out existence in regards to how life is treated here gives me an insight that we as humans dont matter that much in comparsion to other animals, given time and what we know about the past. We are just like ants nothing more. \n\nSo i am just happy about being alive and trying to understand why things are the way they are i am curious what is your outlook on this, staying grounded and keeping in mind all of what i have just written here. \n\nAlso i belive that almost all western internet lives in delusion how reality looks because they have it so good. Check out statistics about homelesness, sicknesses, hunger, wars, about 800 mln people have no access to electricty, and then come back to your phone and think again if what you are writing here is actually not delusional. Bubble, propaganda, people being in their heads, not thinking of outside world. Who has made things you are using, including phone (kids in Congo mining coltan) If you were ok you would help those in need, not talking about your ego boosting \"awakening\" that mean basically \" i know so much omg\" while on the other side someone is suffering. I am at least not running away from the fact that i am to some extent ignorant and i am not helping those in need also my purpose isnt aligned with helping those in need i rather feed my ego and look for peace for myself. Maybe you too and you are too full of yourself to admit.",

          "content": "There are few things that make me have doubts more than this. Some of you might have heard of it, a few years ago, a Norwegian celebrity came out and said that the \"illusion\" of life after death takes advantage of people, he wanted to prove that it's not real. He set up a secret code and so far, no psychic or medium has been able to find it or communicate with him. I would have said, all that study proved was that those specific mediums couldn't contact him, but apparently that's making excuses.\n\nI just... I'm upset about it. I had a devastating loss and I'm angry for my parents, who lost their kid at a very young age and have had people shit all over their comfort. Now, there are fraudulent mediums, yes, but I don't get how it does anyone harm for us to believe we'll see her again. Not just that, but we *have* had experiences with ADCs, and I've been gaslighted by people trying to convince me that they didn't happen. But why are there so many stories like this? Where people ask for signs and don't get them and with this guy, apparently, nobody has contacted him. Honestly, for trying to take that comfort away from people, part of me does wish his soul was just destroyed. I know that's silly but I wouldn't want to make contact with such an asshole. And the skeptic community loves it. The guys dead now. And I don't give a shit. He wanted to do something to help people being \"deluded\", and probabymade many feel depressed or suicidal from losing hope.\n\nI find it hard to take these things seriously because not too long ago, the story about Houdini's wife was circulated online. She asked for an ADC and never got it, apparently. The thing is, some sources say she did get it eventually but just kept it private. But it's just- what is with people wanting to *disprove* everything? I'd there any merit to it? Did this Norwegian guy prove any points? It's just disheartening.",

Instruments idk how to play and voices I've never heard are singing the way I want them to. It's all original and even the lyrics come out spontaneously without me giving them much thought. It lasts for some time till the song is over and then I don't remember it ever again.\n\nI've tried to sit and recollect but I fail everytime. I've wanted to pen down the lyrics or play my guitar the way it's played so effortlessly in my head - I always fail to do it at that moment.\n\nPS - I've had good intuition most of my life. I just know something is about to happen and it happens minutes/years later. Not just obvious things but actual unpredictable things. I also have good childhood memory which dates back to the time I was born and verified incidents of the time I wad maybe few months old.\n\nHow do I get a grip on it? Understand it Maybe?",

This self-realization leads to God-realization. We experience God in the temple of our heart. We realize every Soul is a Spark Of Unique Life, is SIP, the Supreme Immortal Power. This leads us to liberation, liberation from all misery on earth and liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Then, ultimately, we reach that state of unification with the Divine when the body dies. There is no mind and ego, ME that carries karma into another birth. We the Divine Soul become one with the supreme. This is Nirvana, Moksha, salvation. This is much beyond enlightenment.",

The basic message is there never was an individual and regardless of what is experienced there is already everything which is whole, or wholeness, and is already free from the need for anything to happen and so is complete, there's just absolute freedom, and it\u2019s the experience of being an individual which covers that over or hides it. Jim Newman on youtube talks about non-duality and does a good job in my opinion at expressing this freedom. But then another thing that also helped is that it can't be ruled out that there is not an intelligence that is the universe or all energy and therefore includes 'us' so we are that intelligence and that is who we really are, again we were never an individual and we were always the oneness and are just as much everyone and everything else as much as the body we are looking from. But regardless of what happens, including an intelligence that is the universe, there is already everything which is whole, complete, and free.",

In 2020 I was introduced to what I know as spirituality and manifestation techniques\u2026 Im into astrology but also do frequent spiritual things like writing affirmations on full/new moons, practice positive self concept and self talk into the mirror while using hz frequencies, i\u2019ve written manifestations with moon water and fire, and  sleeping to theta frequencies to connect to my\nsubconscious to strengthen my manifestations of my desired reality.. i\u2019ve even tried to speak myself into a new reality as i have found interest in \u201cthe universe experiencing itself of it all\u201d and law of assumption -esq vibes  (i\u2019ve gotten my energy cleansed once  before by a professional spiritual\npractice (i can\u2019t remember her actual title) but she saw the energy within my chakras and cleared it back in 2021.  and dabbled in crystals \u2026. ) \n\nSince october , Ive been focusing on a few specific manifestations and i just got news today that one of the ones i was hoping to manifest turned out to not be what i had wanted\u2026.. \n\nI just don\u2019t know why I, when writing these affirmations /practicing these manifestation techniques\u2026 I feel so strongly and so surely in myself and what I manifesting I give back a lot of gratitude in my letters/positive self talk to myself into the universe and the things I asked for aren\u2019t presented to me :( a little bummed as I was manifesting something very specific to my future and I am sad that it didn\u2019t \u201dcome true\u201d in real time after getting word today \u2026 any tips on what I can do to strengthen my connection with the universe/myself, so I can better bring my manifestations to me faster and exactly like i asked?",

Go back to his place again, and I asked if I would ever see him again, and basically got a no but in a nice way. I thought it was the end of that. But 2 weeks later, I was literally at a completely different club in a different area and he was there again. Go back to his place, part 3. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t sound that shocking, but it\u2019s New York City. Like it\u2019s huge here. I barely run into my friends. I find it really strange I ran into the same guy so many times in different places. He\u2019s also met all my friends, each time I would go out with different close friends and now he\u2019s met my entire friend circle. My best friend since GRADE SCHOOL came to visit that one weekend and met him too. I want to know if this has any meaning, because I really like him (our personalities go well, like when I would go home with him, we would actually talk about everything, in the morning cuddle and talk too) but obviously he doesn\u2019t feel the same way back.",

          "content": "On 2/22/2022 I was seeing so many videos saying to manifest on this date. Reason was a mirror date is the best day because anything you wanted to focus on could reflect basically for your future. Think love life, career, etc. I was in a difficult time in my life. I hated my job and I just left a toxic relationship. I felt like my entire life purpose was being questioned. Turning 30 you think everything would be figured out but it wasn\u2019t the case. I felt very lost in so many ways.\n\nAnyway, I decided to manifest that night and be open to what I would feel. I am pretty spiritual so I am already very open and willing to these things. I found a sound frequency guided meditation playlist and I began to silence my thoughts in the dark. It\u2019s best to let the frequencies guide me through this process and let go. I had been practicing meditation for a few weeks before this so I got pretty deep. I asked myself career wise what is my purpose what could I see myself doing. I then saw myself believe it or not doing permanent makeup which I was interested in. Many things were gravitating me to the tattoo industry itself as well. \n\nI was about another 30 minutes in and began to ask about my purpose in life. I was dealing with so much depression and self consciousness. I saw my elder self and felt as if she was there hugging me and smiling. So warm and so friendly. I envisioned her with long gray hair and she made me feel that everything was going to be ok. With my eyes still closed I moved into a sitting position and leaned to the right to cry on her shoulder. I felt overwhelmed so I opened my eyes to end the mediation and felt like I made a major breakthrough.\n\nThe next day I go to my warehouse job and they announce they are closing. My jaw dropped because I was manifesting a change in career but was not expecting it to be so strong to shut down the whole dang place! (Jk we were slowly going bankrupt prior to this night) so eventually we close, I start a tattoo apprenticeship and have now been doing tattoos and pmu for over a year. I am currently now with my soul mate and have non stop seen angel numbers since this day. I will always remember how vivid my meditative visions were.",

I admit I have over the course of time proven to have a bit of an anxious attachment style in relationships, but I have felt it less with the guy I am with now. \n\nI met someone almost three years back who I instantly clicked with, through work. Things were hot and cold, and a year later (after he had moved on to a new job) we reconnected and confessed our mutual feelings for each other. I ended up cutting it off as I was about to move to a different country and I felt he was messing me around again, and we haven't really spoken since. I unfollowed him on Instagram, but he still follows me and likes every post I make.\n\nMy thing that I am caught up on though, is that I can't seem to shake him from my mind. It isn't necessarily an everyday thing, but it is too constant that I think about him. Some days nothing, but other days I am - almost obsessively thinking of him. I don't know if this has a spiritual meaning or not, I would just like to see what others have to think of it. Nothing intimate has ever happened between us, only that we both knew we had feelings for one another, and the sexual tension was crazy. \n\nUsually I'd be able to shake something like this off, but it hasn't so far. And I worry it won't any time soon. I don't know what to do or if my subconscious is telling me something. I don't necessarily want to be with him right now, as he was always so hot and cold and it was all so confusing with him. But I just don't understand why I can't shake him from my mind. \n\nPlease help if you can.",

However, via the influence of my more spiritually attuned fianc\u00e9, a few uniue experiences and life forcing me to hit my rock bottom I've become interested in and hyperfixated on exploring my spirituality. I'm ready to let go of my hangups and my unwillingness to believe in anything and start taking my life into my own hands, starting from the inside out.\n\nI've been lurking reddit forums and youtube channels looking for information on where to start, and tried picking up a few used books that were very cheap. But I take such a clinical approach to research and learning on my own, and beyond my fianc\u00e9 and his own limited knowledge, I don't have any outside guidance on the topic. I get the feeling I'm not going to pick up on this easily -- I am willing to put the work in, but I'd love some advice on where to start.\n\nI understand how broad this topic is, so ANY and all advice is appreciated! Even if it isn't exactly related to the question at hand, if it feels important to mention to a spiritually stunted beginner please do. I am open to learning in many different areas and want to know what 'spirituality' means to different people.\n\n\\--\n\nAs a sidenote, not necessarily as the main point of my post, I am interested in one particular theory I stumbled upon and have been trouble finding information on. I was not exactly 100% awake at the time and it was on TikTok, so I don't remember what it was called or all of the details. But it pertained to this idea that entire universe is one entity, higher than any one god or divine being, that takes many different forms in order to \"taste\" and experience itself. Like, \"your belief becomes your experience,\" \"you are god and so is everything else,\" or something to that effect. If this rings a bell or shares any similarities with any belief systems, practices or religions, please let me know because I am very curious!\n\n&#x200B;",

          "content": "The Complementary Nature of the Hero's Journey and the Fool's Journey\r  \nThe Hero's Journey and the Fool's Journey, while distinct in their narratives and symbolism, are complementary frameworks that together provide a comprehensive understanding of the human experience. These two journeys, one rooted in mythological exploration and the other in the symbolic progression of the Tarot, each reveal different but interconnected facets of an individual's path through life.\r  \n\r  \nThe Hero's Journey\r  \nJoseph Campbell's Hero's Journey, derived from his study of world mythologies, is a template that outlines the stages of a hero's adventure in the external world. This journey starts with the Call to Adventure, leading to the Crossing of the Threshold into a world of unknown challenges and opportunities. The hero faces Trials and Tribulations, receives Aid from mentors, and undergoes a Transformation. After achieving their goal or gaining new wisdom, the hero Returns to the ordinary world, often with a boon or insight to benefit society. This journey is outward-facing and action-oriented, focusing on physical and societal challenges and achievements.\r  \n\r  \nThe Fool's Journey\r  \nIn contrast, the Fool's Journey through the Tarot's Major Arcana symbolizes an inner spiritual and psychological journey. Beginning with The Fool, representing innocence and the potential for a new start, the journey progresses through various archetypal stages, reflecting an introspective path of self-discovery and personal growth. The journey involves encountering and integrating different aspects of the self, represented by the diverse figures and symbols of the Major Arcana, and culminates in The World, symbolizing wholeness and enlightenment. This journey is inward-looking, focusing on internal struggles, personal insights, and spiritual development.\r  \n\r  \nIntegration of the Two Journeys\r  \nThese two journeys, while distinct, are not mutually exclusive but rather complement each other. The Hero's Journey represents our engagement with the external world, our actions, and interactions within society, and the roles we play. It is about overcoming external obstacles, achieving goals, and the impact of our actions on the world around us. The Fool's Journey, meanwhile, represents our inner world, our subconscious, emotions, thoughts, and spiritual growth. It is about personal transformation, understanding our deeper selves, and the evolution of our consciousness.\r  \n\r  \nIncorporating Jung's Spirit of the Times and Depth\r  \nIntegrating Jung's concepts of the Spirit of the Times (Zeitgeist) and the Depth (the exploration of the unconscious) adds another layer to our understanding of these journeys.\r  \n\r  \nSpirit of the Times in the Journeys\r  \nThe Spirit of the Times, or Zeitgeist, refers to the prevailing cultural, social, and intellectual climate of an era. In the context of the Hero's Journey, it influences the societal norms, challenges, and expectations that the hero encounters and responds to. The journey becomes a reflection of the external world's values and conflicts at that time. In the Fool's Journey, the Spirit of the Times may manifest in the way personal growth and self-realization are understood and pursued, reflecting the collective consciousness and shared human experiences of the era.\r  \n\r  \nDepth and the Unconscious\r  \nDepth, in Jungian terms, refers to the exploration of the unconscious aspects of the psyche. In the Hero's Journey, this exploration might involve confronting personal fears, unconscious motives, or repressed aspects that are projected onto external challenges. In the Fool's Journey, the exploration of depth is more direct, as the journey itself is a path through the unconscious, encountering and integrating various hidden aspects of the self.\r  \n\r  \nConclusion\r  \nTogether, the Hero's Journey and the Fool's Journey, enriched by Jung's concepts of the Spirit of the Times and Depth, create a holistic view of the human journey. They encompass both the external and internal realms, the conscious and unconscious dimensions, and the influence of the collective cultural climate. This integrated perspective offers a profound understanding of the multifaceted nature of human existence, the process of personal and societal evolution, and the journey towards self-awareness and fulfillment in both the physical and spiritual realms.",

          "content": "I don't know if I sound crazy for it but whatever. \n\nI gave my first ex a vile of my blood (I know, stupid, but I didn't know any better and I was 15), I abruptly broke up with her like a month later since it wasn't working out. I'm not sure if she was big on Witchcraft etc., but I'm pretty sure she's done certain things and mainly played with stuff regarding the dead (she's done a few seances before), thought I don't know about curses she's performed.   \nWhen I was in a relationship with her, I'm not sure if this counts as a curse, I was practically obsessed with her, I couldn't think about anything but her and when I was away from her I also only thought about her.   \nI never had that happen to me before, but I didn't really think much of it.   \nAfter that my love life was basically garbage.   \nI'm a pretty average person in regards of character and looks etc. so I don't think it's because of my character nor looks either.\n\nI'm also a very mentally healthy person, self-confident person , I get good grades, I love my family, I'm nice to animals and to strangers. I don't think I'm a shit person either that could put others off. \n\nI've had a lot of people confess their love to me too, obviously I didn't date all of them. \n\nBut when I try getting closer to them they often go along with it the first few weeks and then later just ignore me fully. Sometimes they even act obsessive to the point where they don't want me to have other friends and whatnot, sometimes they make a lot of sexual jokes, even way older guys. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe relationships I've been in after the first girl were all abusive and unsuccessful. \n\nI've dated a guy and a girl after her. \n\nThe girl turned out to be a psycho who has tried killing others before and who threatened to hurt herself if I broke up with her. \n\nThe guy turned out to be possessive af and didn't want me to hang out with others at all.   \nEvery friendship I've had with a guy afterwards also turned possessive or they just ended up playing with my feelings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think I attract these type of people though, since my close friends are completely different. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post, I wanted to give as many details as possible :D",

          "author": "ramonapap1",
          "content": "How to adapt to this new understanding of reality after gaining spiritual insights?\n\nI see our reality as a theatre. We're basically living in this massive show directed by money, and the top 1% has crafted and perfected the script. We vote for the people they tell us to, watch the movies they put out, and eat the food they provide. Supermarkets are filled with their brands, making it hard to find alternatives. The food they give us is often very much processed, loaded with toxic and addictive stuff. They make unhealthy food because it is the cheapest and most convenient, creating an offer we can't easily refuse. We become addicted in many ways, and they tempt us everywhere. Everything is full of billboards and commercial, the ads being pushed everywhere we might look.\n\nWhen we get sick from consuming their unhealthy food, we're left with little choice but to sacrifice financial stability for our health. We end up paying thousands to facilities they own, where they prescribe us more harmful chemicals that most of the times just numb the symptoms.  \nWe go to schools eight hours a day learning what they want us to learn. They grab our attention at age 5 and never really give it back. They scold us until we obey, then praise us when we do. We form a habit of spending our entire day in a building we wouldn't choose, so when we grow up, we're okay doing the same. Following orders becomes comfortable after a childhood of doing what we're told.  \nThey tell us we should do anything to go to university because  otherwise we fail. \n\nThey manipulate us into financial dependence early on so we stay chained to the system. They've given us a currency which has value only because they say so and we collectively agreed with it. We earn it working for businesses they own. Their wealth multiplies while the rest of us are forced to sacrifice our time for minuscule fraction of what our work gains for them. Housing is provided,  but made it very costly, making it tough to accumulate enough wealth to escape from this show. Society is structured around addictive foods causing disease and expensive drugs masking them, keeping us trapped.  \nWe only consume content they provide. News channels are run by them to push opposing perspectives, preventing us from sharing the same opinion. They feed us shocking news to grab our attention away from what's really happening in the world. Superficial idols with luxurious lifestyles are granted to us so we associate money with happiness.\n\nThey keep us focused on worldly problems they've created to distract us from our higher selves. If we concentrate on our surroundings, we'll never be present and realize our true power within ourselves. \n\nImagine if everyone believed we exist for a reason, and we are all connected to something bigger than us. We'd unlock an unbreakable faith within ourselves and reverse the power structure society was built on. We'd see past the lies, turn to each other for help, and stop depending on corrupt leaders.  \nThe majority of us see the world as it's portrayed \u2013 diverse and plausible. But looking behind the curtain, we find lies, endless deception, and a power trip that's been ongoing since the very beginning. It will continue until we see a reason for change and stop hating and blaming each other.\n\nAm I crazy, or my reality is just different than yours? Spirituality brought a lot of positive changes in my life but it also feels sometimes very challenging to balance it with practicality.  \n\nIf you made it this far sorry for the long post and thanks for reading it. <3 ",

          "author": "ShelterCorrect",
          "content": "So I got a sound bowl two years ago for my 18th birthday but I never found the time to use it. Then a few months ago I was looking into sound therapy to reduce the programming of music on my brain (In my religion music is banned) and so i realized the sound bowl can produce binaural beats naturally in contrast to the computer generated binaural beats.\r  \n\r  \nI was using the sound bowl simply for experimenting with potent frequencies on my brain, but what I found next was nothing short of a miracle in my eyes.\r  \n\r  \nYou see I\u2019ve been suffering from auditory and visual hallucinations for a hot minute now, and soon the more I started striking the sound bowl, the more it began to neutralize the hallucinations as it overpowered the noise in my brain. It\u2019s weird, it\u2019s like the binaural beats are digging deep within my mind and cancelling out all the noise it produces.\r  \n\r  \nThere is something psychological about sound therapy that taps into the unseen parts of the mind in where hallucinations are produced. My conspiracy theory behind it is that my brain produces low frequencies that I cannot hear that spawns the hallucinations. And so when I play potent healthy frequencies it taps into the root cause of the hallucinations, essentially nipping it in the bud.\r  \n\r  \nThis has been an amazing coping mechanism for my schizophrenia and I\u2019ve likened it to a fidget toy for people with adhd. This is like a spiritual fidget toy for people with schizophrenia.\r  \n\r  \nI hope this knowledge benefits you in some way. I am currently writing a 40 day journal on the sound therapy and it\u2019s going by really well.\r  \n\r  \nThanks for reading! Have a wonderful day.",

          "content": "Constant happiness or eternal bliss does exist. But for this you have to go to the state of truth consciousness. What is truth consciousness? Truth consciousness is the state of thoughtlessness, the state of awareness or mindfulness. When you block the mind, you lock the mind and you activate the intellect, then you discriminate the truth from the myth. And when you are in consciousness of the truth, then you reach a state of eternal peace and everlasting happiness. You realize that this world is a cosmic illusion. You realize that everything is a drama, and life is karma, then there is no trauma. To reach that state of constant happiness, we need to reach that state of liberation from misery and sorrow. We need to stop jumping into yesterday and tomorrow. We need to tame the monkey mind. All this happens, when we reach that state of truth consciousness. Then we will experience eternal bliss.",

          "content": "How many of us really think we agreed to everything prior to incarnating here to what we\u2019re experiencing, or that this all even stems from human activity alone? Yes, we make personal choices to change our thinking and behaviors, and implement better ways of doing things. But is our own personal work we\u2019re doing alone enough? Enough to bring in this \u2018New Earth\u2019 that\u2019s talked about in spiritual communities, whatever that truly means? \n\nMany people say all you need to do is become conscious and practice your consciousness in the ways we do with meditation and all that. But is this alone enough? Primarily asked since there\u2019s a lot of increasing influences and distortions that can deter an individual off their track, multiple times. \n\nGoing back to- It can\u2019t be fathomed how these \u2018positive \u2018 or less dense beings ( I\u2019ll include here less density upward ascension models still includes the unconsciousness we have to bring to light, hence the graduations through the polarity) could agree to allow the degree of the turmoil. That we agreed to all of it\u2026It\u2019s like politics, the republicans and democrats. They represent two sides of the spectrum fighting on behalf of two very \u2018different\u2019 sides when they\u2019ve been pictured eating together, like a family\u2026 There\u2019s a game of what we think is going on vs other missing moving parts that are just as much relevant and imperative that what we don\u2019t fully take into account that would help to get the greater picture of this story. \n\nMeditating on these questions especially asking beings during this can lead to having some correct answers whilst can leave you on a goose chase with the rest of it. Your own gnosis would be better developed if provoking the \u2018knowns\u2019.  In saying this, we can\u2019t always avoid falling into pitfalls to really find out the answers. You can\u2019t always protect yourself from these things that we all need to know in our own way in a varied systemic environment. Feeling duped will come about because we didn\u2019t \u2018get the assignment\u2019 but what\u2019s a test with all the answers given. We think that knowing things ahead of time will prevent disasters, but it is what it is. This is the real assignment though. To grow through and out of our ignorance in all the ways that are presented. To grow an inner strength that will help give us leaps and bounds to what we can accomplish in our lifetimes here with our mental/psychic abilities, giving a more wholesome development overall and understanding on things. \n\nWe may know things but not simultaneously and it\u2019s difficult to get it out in edgewise so we\u2019ll present what we have experienced thus far. There\u2019s that. It would be very advantageous to ask ourselves again especially with how much has changed, what we\u2019ve been told or learned long ago, whether we asked ourselves or others especially beings, the same questions now with the underlying energies of the present time. To compare and contrast an older version of that which was understood vs now how it\u2019s understood. The former doesn\u2019t always stand up to the now so it\u2019s good to test these understands along the way, whether that be religions, traditions, thought processes, etc\u2026\n\n\u2018What we do here echoes out into eternity\u2019, said someone. What we do here affects our other selves since we\u2019re multidimensional beings. But if we can\u2019t find our way through the deceptions in this dimension and one\u2019s we connect to (as above so below) then how are we going to recognize what\u2019s what upon escaping the prison plane if we can\u2019t escape these things here whilst living here first?  How are we going to join with our other selves or be able to go to where we want after leaving here without learning the important concepts? Developing spiritual practices, so many to consider. But If you have an inclination to assist more on a system level then don\u2019t ignore those nudges as well. If our consciousness is informed of a more boots on the ground approach to also help move things along, that\u2019s very advantageous. I realized after the help of others\u2019 perspectives to have a more wholistic discernment of the masquerading energies, but that it\u2019s all a masquerade. What do you do? Follow your own suit. Following your own truth while editing yourself along the way with the above considerations in mind and whatever other considerations that\u2019ll assist in remembering our personal truth.\n\nThe Mind\n\nIf we know that there\u2019s the idea of the mind and how expansive that is and how we\u2019re all a part of that, then why have we relegated much of the understanding of psychology to mean only human psychology, not connecting that to what is known as \u2018The Mind\u2019? The different nuances, the interplay with our mind with with greater one? Saying this isn\u2019t an evasion of taking personal responsibility to give ourselves the care we need, but there seems to be this responsibility we have that has a much farther reach, hence why I mention this. Yes there\u2019s different branches of psychology and the closest we have is panpsychism, then there\u2019s transpersonal psychological and parapsychology and other concepts that connect the spiritual to the human, yet there\u2019s still this reduction placed on how we can more accurately relate to what we experience in our human experience, our mental process to that of the greater mental workings in greater capacities. And if by knowing this we could get a more cohesive understanding and approaches to caring for our selves. \n\nThis can be beneficial PSA for those who\u2019ve been dismissed or plainly redirected to a therapist for their mental discord, which is described as plainly mental illness, but wonder how some of the discord can also be remediated by a more cohesive thought, and how it\u2019s not going to be all solvable going to a therapist alone. But having a wholistic practice to feel connected to self in all ways and not feel so disconnected, to continue feeding in the separation idea.\n\nThere used to be a more thorough understanding, (not that there isn\u2019t now it\u2019s just more divisive) an acceptance many years ago in how psychology, the psyche, included the mind that spanned across space and time, how we divorced our perceptions from that and reduced it to the psychology we know is, well, isn\u2019t hard to believe given the topic discussed. Anyhow, that\u2019s what I have for now. Take care.",

          "content": "Thoughts on stuff\u2026\n\nThe fact all things in this universe as we generally can understand have a polarity of positive and negative. That all things in existence have the characteristics within, from nature to humans to others. Including the beings that are called upon worked in spiritual/occult practices. \n\nHow are we certain that all are good or all are bad on an all inclusive reality? How did we get that mixed up. Because if we think about it when we say false light vs say real light, this wouldn\u2019t be accurate based on the reality of things. Perhaps we wanted to believe that there is something out there that\u2019s genuinely good so we make these distinctions when really there\u2019s gradients of densities, positive or negative: these two \u2018opposites\u2019 occur on a spectrum. Both sides lie for what agendas they want to be accomplished which ultimately boils down to the one agenda. Neither have any obligation to you, to really like you, let alone \u2018love\u2019 you, and to actually take your best interest at heart. To a degree yes but again taking into consideration what the return is for them.\n\nIf you take the example of how humans are some, most (however you want to look at it) are generally ok, good, they might help you or they may not. That\u2019s their choice. If they help you sometimes you get the outcome you wanted sometimes not. There\u2019re maybe manipulations, gaslighting involved into getting what you wanted too. But then how and why would this reflection outwards not be the same as the other beings\u2019 behaviors? Why do we think they are excluded from participating in being liars and deceivers when they too are over compensating for a lack, a separation we have yet to understand? Interestingly a separation we too share? \n\nIs there ever any wonder though on how that all gets orchestrated behind the scenes and other beings, the interaction of our will, the other persons will vs the beings will? The universe? When you ask them and present them your case and want a certain outcome, how does your will stands against theirs? How do we know we couldn\u2019t have gotten a better outcome than we did or didn\u2019t have to toil for things as long and hard a we did? Sure there\u2019s lessons and things to go through but is that the whole story? \n\nIts like a political hodgepodge, battle of wills the war on your attention for their actions we support when we don\u2019t know fully what we support given the dynamics. A parade of blended dogmas for a singular major cause.\n\nMy point is there\u2019s this game, or paradigm that exists most all know about by the name of the Matrix, about the negative entities, \u2018agents\u2019 and the harvesting of humans and all that jazz. But you ever wonder how the more \u2018positive\u2019 beings could\u2019ve allowed things to happen in congruence to\u2019 their\u2019 game alone and then there\u2019s this growing confusion that occurs resulting in us thinking it\u2019s just \nall the negative entities against humanity and this planet? That they alone are the culprits for all the mayhem on Earth?\n\nThis game was probably agreed upon by both sides to make it look like it was one over the other. Hence the separation game and all the manifestations from this basis. Then somehow we inherited this idea that we \u2018agreed\u2019 to all these terms and conditions prior to incarnating into this Earth existence and feel obligated to support this notion, thereby causing delays and barriers in our paths we don\u2019t fully understand? I can see to a point us agreeing to degrees of separation, to an extent and on a personal front, but to what extent that has transpired collectively, I don\u2019t agree to all things that \u2018should\u2019 have and does happen here. To what extent we agreed and continue to\u2026I guess not all were going to become privy to the terms and conditions as well, but have adopted anyway this idea it\u2019s all \u2018gods plan\u2019 and to just trust and have faith to go with the flow. And to support this notion of balance that we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re helping to keep a balance of. \n\nThe balance changes when there\u2019s shifts in cycles, astrologically and so on. The \u2018balance\u2019 that was set eons ago by certain beings on this plane is absolutely subject to this, hence the post. It\u2019s like double speak. You\u2019re told \u2018 it\u2019s all about balance\u2019 yet we\u2019re fighting this balance because we know inherently things aren\u2019t right and were caught in this tug of war to keep our ground, do our practices but we\u2019re still entangled on what keeps us stuck. Hence this not fully understood tethering to the system. Not sure how else to describe it.",

          "content": "Hello everyone, happy Sunday to some of you! I've been wearing makeup every day since I was 13, feeling extremely insecure without it. My mom, who's very superficial, always preferred me in makeup, especially due to my severe acne. And even expected me to put it on before breakfast at weekends if I didn\u2019t she wouldn\u2019t stop nagging about my face. Yes i grew up in a very toxic household.\n In 2016 when I was almost 17, I started at a new school and was too tired to put on makeup one morning. That day marked the end of my daily makeup routine. Around the same time, I fell into depression, which made me care less and less about my appearance. I became passionate about sustainable fashion, avoiding fast fashion, and generally stopped focusing on my looks. This led to a drastic change in my appearance, and I noticed people sometimes reacted negatively to my \"homeless\" look, a term I use for lack of a better description, not to disrespect anyone. It is  not over exaggerated I really do look homeless sometimes  in my daily life \n\nEven in college, while I started caring a bit more, I rarely wore makeup due to my skin issues with acne my skin just hates it. I have a lot of red and purple scars now so even tho I have less cystic acne it still looks like my face is full of it.  My style hasn't improved much, though I occasionally enjoy dressing up. Despite no longer being depressed, I struggle to find the motivation to care about my appearance more again or a way of not feeling like anything that has to do with beauty in humans is just so extremely superficial and hurtful to so many. I mean I just do not actually  look the way I look when I put on my makeup and I don\u2019t want ppl to just like me bc I look approachable and not ugly and weird. Also clothes are just clothes and the reason I wear them nowadays is simply bc I need to wear something. \nBut I do really miss the joy of dressing up and feel dissatisfied with how I present myself.\n I know I do not like what I see in the mirror but I still feel like it\u2019s meaningless anyways to care about changing that. But lately I have  realised again he importance of aesthetics and being able see and create beautiful things and it is a beautiful thing to expirence this as a human in this lifetime. But even tho I never stopped loving beauty in nature and in design and also in other peoples creative expressions and looks I can not start caring about this with myself again. How are you able to start caring about appearance and feel like it\u2019s not plain stupid once you realised all of it is extremely meaningless?",

Earlier I was outside of my balcony getting some fresh air as I sat there letting my emotions go in my notes app. I use journaling as a way for me to let out any feelings I'm feeling in the moment to help me feel better by letting it off my chest. \n\n\nWhen I did so, I not only felt better and a bit happier, I literally looked up to see a honeybee land on my house. To me, this feels divine. I was just having a depressive episode and once I let out my emotions and felt better, I definitely feel like that seeing this bee means something.

For the longest time, despite being spiritual, despite being a believer and perhaps something beyond that since I've had my own experiences, I have been reluctantly skeptical of anything to do with spirituality. It's become this routine to try to rule out every single skeptic explanation of something before I can accept it and I hate it.\n\nNow, I know skepticism is good in moderation, but at this point I want to let go and accept what I've been through. Between the atheist communities, figures like Dawkins and Hitchens, I feel fragile. You hear that there's no evidence of a soul existing and it's strange, it really comes down to what you define and accept as evidence, but it can still be disheartening to hear. To hear people still say it's all in the brain. To hear all this stuff, NDEs, out of body experiences, the signs you receive from departed loved ones, to have it all brushed off and head that it's \"debunked\", even if that isn't true, still makes it seem like thats the case.\n\nReddit is just rife with this mindset. I've had people gaslight me, try to convince me that certain things that I *know* happened didn't. People try to convince me I'm a mindless, soulless biological entity and a machine, just this sack of meat and chemicals. It's dehumanising. To have it framed as a \"cold hard truth\" that I'm too fragile to accept. Makes me think I'm the problem then, makes me second guess absolutely fucking everything. I just want it to stop.",

These are all things you will experience in life. The experiences themselves are similar to any other; we go through them, and then they leave an imprint on our souls. However weird this may sound, it is critical to embrace them. Wrestle with them until you come to terms with them.\n\nI'll use a physical example. I have been taking cold showers to try and build up resistance. It's winter, and I have poor insulation for the pipes, so the water is unbearably cold. I shout and squirm, resist the experience as much as possible, and then justify quitting early for whatever reason. Today, however, I sat there and let the frigid water run over my head until it went numb. I embraced the pain (to a reasonable point), and suddenly, the water felt fine over the rest of my body. Suddenly, I could deal with it as if it weren't happening. \n\nI am not saying the point of life is suffering or that you should run toward pain. Instead, there is a type of embrace or acceptance of the negative feelings, emotions, and experiences you have that allows them to become a part of your life without destroying it.\n\nI have been going through some soul-wrenching pain; I lost my children (still living), my family has turned away from me, and I have no partner in life. I experience pain constantly. Running from it and pushing it out leads to more pain and more suffering. Embracing the experience for what it is allows you to grow. \n\nLet me know what you guys think. Agree/disagree? What are your experiences? How do you deal with pain?

It's often said or assumed that reaching the highest state of consciousness involves unifying with the whole and losing one's ego and identity. While I understand the problems associated with an overinflated ego, I'm not entirely convinced that completely losing one's sense of self is necessary or even desirable to achieve a greater state of consciousness.\r  \n\r  \nThis brings me to my dilemma and the reason for my post: Why is there such a strong emphasis on losing the ego and identity in many spiritual practices? Is it truly necessary to dissolve these aspects of ourselves to reach higher states of consciousness or to attain enlightenment?\r  \n\r  \nSome points I've been considering are:\r  \n\r  \nThe Role of the Ego: The ego, despite its issues, plays a crucial role in our survival and daily functioning. Is it possible to maintain a healthy ego while pursuing higher consciousness?\r  \n\r  \nIdentity and Individuality: Our unique identities and experiences shape who we are. Is losing this sense of individuality truly beneficial, or is there a way to balance individuality with a sense of oneness?\r  \n\r  \nDifferent Philosophical Perspectives: Different traditions and philosophies offer varying views on this subject. Are there traditions that value the preservation of individual identity in the journey towards enlightenment?\r  \n\r  \nPersonal Experiences: For those who have delved deeply into these practices, how has your relationship with your ego and identity changed?\r  \n\r  \nI'm genuinely interested in understanding different perspectives on this topic. Whether you have a background in philosophy, spirituality, psychology, or just personal insights, I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.",

He is finally able to accept the fact that all the dreams has broken & he has to live with this reality. \n\nThis fact becomes so intense & so dense that will give him his life back, gives him energy to get over it & start a new life.

          "author": "tryingtolive22",
          "content": "There is this one person who I am not really close to  (she's not a friend or family member) that exudes a lot of negativity towards me. I can't avoid her because she is my coworker and I have to work closely with her in particular. I have tried sending love, wishing her well, and realizing that I sometimes may be internalizing too much. I have also realized that maybe since she is already a bit \"mean\" that I may be  magnifying her micro-behaviors that may not be meant to be intentionally passive-aggressive.\n\nI have tried meditating to see what the problem is but I just can't pin-point this repulsion I feel towards her. I guess I was caught off guard because in the beginning when I met her she was super nice to me and pretended to be super close, and then she started acting all rude and distant (not saying hi to me even when I greet her, avoiding eye contact when I speak to her, her facial expressions of repulsion towards me). I don't know what I did. She just changed from one day to another. I think the only thing that may have made her switch was the fact that (I SUSPECT) that she liked one of my coworkers, and he was very friendly with me (I don't like him but we are friends) and she thought may be I was competition??? Anyway long story short about that, I have a feeling they are a friends with benefits now but still... why would she hate me for that if they're already a 'thing'? But like I said... I don't know if this is the exact reason why she switched from one day to another, but it's honestly the only situation that I could think of. (Another thing I should note is that my guy coworker has also starting acting more negative and distant, not always directly towards me but just in general, ever since he started hanging out with her. He used to be super friendly with me and now he avoids me and his attitude is more negative about work).\n\nWhat confuses me even more is that sometimes when I come into the office she's like \"Hi tryingtolive22!\" and she opens her arms to give me a hug. BUT IT FEELS SO FAKE! Like yesterday you were acting distant, and now you want to give me a hug??? Her hot and cold behavior is so confusing\n\nI guess I now feel repulsion towards her because she's giving off those feelings to me. I have asked other coworkers about her and they admit that even though she is not outwardly mean to them, she gives off a mean vibe. \n\nI honestly don't know what to do anymore to not get affected by her negativity. I feel like her negativity is making me a toxic person. Like somehow I want to one-up her since she wants to one-up me. I all of a sudden feel jealous of her. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M JEALOUS ABOUT! There's nothing that she has that I want, but I still feel this 'jealousy' towards her. I now want to be better than her at my job. I'm not like this with others. I have never been a competitive person (that's why I never played sports lol). I can't avoid her which is the worst part. I don't want to have these feelings of repulsion towards her. I send her love and pray for her but it feels fake of me to do that because I feel this repulsion.\n\nI know these are childish feelings and what's going on in the office is quite childish too. I am pushing 30 and I never thought I would feel like I'm in high school all over again. \n\nTL;DR- My coworker is giving off toxic vibes which has made me feel toxicity towards her. I don't want to have these feelings of toxicity towards her. I have tried to send love and pray for her but I still feel this repulsion towards her. I have meditated but I can't pin-point why this is affecting me so much. Meditation only works temporarily. I have thought about having a conversation with her, but I realized that some people may not be self-aware of their behavior (or admit to their behavior), and it may make things even more awkward. WHAT CAN I DO? I AM REALLY FRUSTRATED! ",

Strictly energy speaking. I feel exhausted after we hang out and I feel like I lose myself when I'm with them. Generally I'm always looking at the positive side of things and I don't ever judge people, I just allow them to be. Being brought up how I was, it's taken some time to cultivate this amazing mindset that I have most of the time. But certain people in my life can be quite negative and very judgemental of others. I find myself sinking to their level. While I don't partake fully, I also don't shut it down because I'm scared of confrontation. And to be quite honest, if I were to shut down everyone in my life when they make a joke at anothers expense, I'd be doing it constantly and most likely end up with no one in my life. Which maybe is better?\n\nI'd love to have the courage to look at the people in my life and just say \"hey, I don't like talking about/judging/making fun of.. etc. other people and would appreciate if you didn't do that around me\" but usually when this happens or I'm around certain people, I feel myself go unconscious and when I'm unconscious I forget who I AM! And I just fall back into my old ways of laughing off uncomfortable situations. Maybe with more growth I'll get there but for now, how do I handle this? Keep my distance? Walk away? Run??? Force myself to speak my mind?\n\nAfter I typed all this out, I feel like I definitely know the answer to this.

Expressing ENFP values. Each type have core values defined in patterns like chakras can be, there is 8 patterns, the ones that ENFPs use are mainly Ne Fi Te Si. What\u2019s amazing is that it also shows the unconscious part of someone and how we are the mirror of each other, it kind of pictures the oneness of all humans, how we are all connected. What\u2019s the most crazy also is that it proves the work of Joseph Campbell on myths, that we have all a hero\u2019s journey built in.\n\nHere is 2 tests to do to be almost sure of your type, 2 tests are needed to avoid biases that each test can have, and this is 2 tests made differently :\n\n- the classic test: https://www.16personalities.com/\n\n- and my test which go deeper: https://theherotest.involve.me/theherotest\n\nIf my test reaches the limit and doesn\u2019t work anymore, use this test instead: https://sakinorva.net/functions\nand give the result from the line \u00ab\u00a0grant function type\u00a0\u00bb.\n\nFYI: I am INFJ.",

Can any one provide additional advice and or resources on this topic? How does one do work on their non material self in order to create material change?",

Only recently I\u2019ve started welcoming some kind of spirituality in my life, and I feel there\u2019s a somewhat strong connection to a bigger picture, a bigger drawing. Since then, I\u2019ve started having incredibly vivid and realistic dreams about the same person. Now, I know this sounds crazy but I really need some advice and I don\u2019 really know who to ask. Keep in mind I have never spoken to this person, and they truly don\u2019t know I exist. Even back when I completely rejected any sort of spirituality, I still knew there was something between us and now I feel it even more, as they show up in my dreams so often. I always dream about us being together and being happy, and I don\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t even realize all this stuff until a couple of months ago, because I couldn\u2019t imagine myself getting such a huge crush (if that\u2019s what all this is) on someone I don\u2019t even know. Do I need to actually start opening up to the universe to open up my path for this person to come, or is it just me going crazy? Do you think there\u2019s any sort of meaning and reason behind this?

I only ever check when I have an urge and that day had been 111 days since my last self harm. Ever since, the frequency is increasing over time to the point I had 9!!! Pictures within 24 hours the other day. I opened up to my friend about it last night and immediately after I walk into the bathroom and there\u2019s a lady bug on my mirror. Probably doesn\u2019t need to be said, but this was super out of the ordinary. I\u2019m keeping it *safely* for now, might sound silly but I sat with it for an hour while it crawled around my hand and I felt like it was a spirit guide itself. (Don\u2019t worry, I had lady bug farms when I was younger so I know how to care for them) I have been working towards connecting back with my spirituality, but it has been tough due to depression. I\u2019m very happy to have these signs, but I desperately want to know what to do with them. Kinda stresses me out.\n\n\n Does anyone have any advice on how to get answers?\n\n\nAlso.

His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence.\r  \n\r  \nThe first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence.\r  \n\r  \nFinally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone.\r  \n\r  \nThe father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, \"You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe little boy then understood how powerful his words were. He looked up at his father and said \"I hope you can forgive me father for the holes I put in you.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Of course I can,\" said the father.\r  \n\r  \nIt's not always anger, it is your actions in general. There are no \"fresh starts\" in life. There is no new beginning. Forgiveness comes easy for many people but the scars of the past, they never go away. Watch what you do today, because sometimes the price isn't worth the reward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\~Source unknown\\~",

I have always felt very connected to the universe, and considered myself to be a spiritual person. I found peace in feeling connected to my soul, and never doubted that my soul would continue its journey after this body died. I also found comfort in some amazing experiences close friends of mine had with mediums. for the past year (as I finished my last year in university) I have been experiencing large waves of depression and hopelessness, paired with an extreme fear of no longer existing after death. Recently, it has caused me to feel severely detached from any of my old practice, and I\u2019ve been becoming increasingly afraid of death. Last night, I came across an article of scientists talking about how our brains can become so afraid of death that they make us fabricate things to help cope, and I think that was a final straw for my mind. I had a huge panic attack, and I can\u2019t shake this feeling that soon everything and everyone I love will just be gone, including me. Everytime I start to feel reconnected to my beliefs, i spiral and tell myself it\u2019s only because I\u2019m looking for comfort about my inevitable death. I hate feeling this way, I miss feeling attached to my soul. I don\u2019t know how find my way back, because everytime I do i just feel like I\u2019m only grasping for comfort about no life after death. Has anyone experienced something similar? What helped you find comfort, or reconnection? I\u2019m starting to become scared of my own brain, and my mental health it starting to decline.

Similarly, in our quest for the cause of action in sain\u032dcara [extroversial movement from the cosmic nucleus], we arrive at the Mahat [existential feeling] of the Great. The mind having no locus standi beyond the Mahat, such a state is the supra-mental state of the mind. In this supra-mental state, it is beyond the capacity of the mind to determine the principle of cause and effect, for further probings will entail the fallacy of infinite regress; that is to say, to think of the existence of the mind in a state where it does not exist is indeed fallacious.

          "content": "There's a pervasive problem in our world, and the cure to the inner conflict of the heart is found in Spiritual practice.  Spiritual practice allows a person to find Love (true nature) and Identity (were God is found).  Once these two are known, unity appears.\n\nOne of the greatest obstacles to this is the misidentified God of the Bible.  Earlier this morning, I outlined this for someone who was challenged by the nature of the Old Testament Lord.  His mind could see the obvious division between Jesus and the Lord of the Old Testament.  If you know and realize the Perennial Truth, you get why the Ego of the Lord was overcome by the Love of the Father of creation.  Even the Son of God had to fight the good fight.  Here is a reposting of the comment.\n\nAnyone who has deconstructed their former organized religious beliefs ask the questions that lead to Spiritual Love and Understanding.  One path leads us to the other once Ego is overcome with Love. This is the good news of the Lord and example of this truth.\n\nThis is the twist to the story you never expected.  God is Love.  Love is patient as we come to see ourselves by the nature of Love, not judgement and pride.  This perennial truth is in all religions.  Know Thyself.\n\n>All your questions on this topic are resolved when you recognize the perennial truth in all religions. Then, it's all clear. Yahweh is a personification of a ruler, power, throne, authority in us all called the EGO. Satan is the conscience, or accuser. My profile has a links page, and under the heading BIBLICAL LORD / ADAM'S EGO, you get the context outlined with every verse.  \n>  \n>When Yahweh realized his law and judgment were judging himself with self-righteous pride, he incarnated as Adam 2. Luke 3:38 tells you his secret identity as Adam. The Son of God (Lord) became a man to pay this price:  \n>  \n>6 Whoever sheds human blood,  \n>  \n>by humans his blood will be shed,  \n>  \n>because in his image, Elohim made humans.  \n>  \n>Now, the one speaking here is the true Father, or Elohim. Now go to 1 John 4 and read the true Father's attitude to judgment and fear.  \n>  \n>**18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.**  \n>  \n>**19 We love because he first loved us.**  \n>  \n>All of the Old Testament was the voice of a self-righteous accuser (devil), even if some of what he said is true. His heart was not true. Jesus called himself (the Lord of the Old Testament) the devil in John 8:44, or father of Israel. By being baptized (incarnated) into the cross (body), he becomes a new creation. The old things are passed away. Check Exodus 4:22-24 to see if Yahweh called himself the father of Israel and tried to murder Moses. He even lies to Pharaoh by telling him he will kill one son, then kills them all, including animals. Did Yahweh love the firstborn son's mothers? No. Only his own selfish goals were on his mind. EGO.  \n>  \n>Murder is not love. It's hate, judgment and the generation of fear in others. He flunks the fruit test, but rises to love as a man. According to jubilee laws, only a kinsman can redeem a kinsman. Unless he pays the cost of his bloodshed, he judges himself. By forgiving others, he chooses the true God and Father of Love.  \n>  \n>Perennial Truth over many books, many authors and many years of writing. This alone shows the authorship of the story overall. It's a shadow, not the living word. It's graven in the image of man, by man and for our realization of the true God. That God stands silent as we grow up and overcome the will to judge, better known as the Ego.  \n>  \n>**Revelation 3**  \n>  \n>**21 To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.**  \n>  \n>Overcoming EGO. Once you know, you cannot unknow. The only sin is pride, or self-righteousness proclaiming self to be God with none beside. Today, is he beside a God, at the right hand? Yes. Verification what I say is true.  \n>  \n>Don't judge him. WE are all him. The story is about us hanging on a cross (body) and incarnated into reality (baptism). Symbolism tells the story accurately. It's the perennial truth of every single religion of the heart, including Budhism, Taoism, Hinduism and all the rest reflected by the inner spirit to love others.  \n>  \n>It's both a way out and a way in. The Great News.\n\nWho are we as humans?\n\n>16 Don\u2019t you know that you yourselves are God\u2019s temple and that God\u2019s Spirit dwells in your midst? 17 If anyone destroys God\u2019s temple, God will destroy that person; for God\u2019s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.\n\nThe world needs to know this truth.  Could it be this truth sets us free from war; from judgment and hatred of others?\n\nThe past life of Jesus is more than we knew.  The Bible is the life review of God.  At death, will our own life review show the same Love of the Father for his Son?  Spirit is the Breath of Life in each person equally.  Watch your breath.\n\n&#x200B;",

So i had just gone through a huge moment of heartbreak, i wont go into detail but it sent me into a really bad depression the past year. so the day this happened i decided to get out of the house and take my dog on a walk through a cemetery down the street from my home. i was crying a lot and was just a mess. as i walked into the cemetery my dogs leash had gotten all tangled around my legs so i spun around to untangle it, and when i looked back in front of me a lady was approaching me and my dog. now at this point i have snot running down my face and my earbuds falling out of my ears and this lady she just talks to my dog. and we just sit there in the middle of the road in the cemetery. she made small talk like what my favorite song was and that kind of a thing. i figured she had just seen i was upset and wanted to comfort me. eventually a car pulled in the road we were sitting on so we moved to a bench nearby. we sat there for maybe 2 hours just chatting. but it was so odd to me because she was talking about all this spiritual stuff and it\u2019s hard to really remember it all now but i remember her saying if you look up at the sky, and you imagine saying \u201cfuck you\u201d to someone (basically being mean to someone) and that it\u2019ll come right back to you. so it\u2019s like saying fuck you to yourself. i\u2019m not sure why this stands out to me it just does. so once it got dark we said our goodbyes and we parted ways. and i remember as she walked away she lit a cigarette and she was just so elegant. and then she was just gone. and i was left in a shock i didn\u2019t know what to do with my self. and then she kept coming back. i kept seeing her around.. and every time i did it felt revolutionary to me. she always gave me good advice and a meaning to our conversations. we even went out and bought clothes together and explored places. or sometimes we\u2019d just sit in silence. there was something so comforting about this lady. she visibly had been using drugs and been homeless but i never questioned her or doubted her. i just talked with her and was there to keep her company. i remember a few times she mentioned her kids but i don\u2019t think she had seen them for awhile. i\u2019m not sure. there was something so pure about her that just really changed my perspective on life. she gave me a little charm once, she said \u201ci\u2019ve been holding onto this for awhile but i don\u2019t need it anymore\u201d , and she handed it to me. i still have it. she even shared a few of her favorite songs with me i still remember them. i just want to know what these interactions were. i was in the darkest place in my life when she stumbled upon me. i don\u2019t know what she was or who she was but i never seen her again after that summer. thank you for reading.",

Those who have got several pabula, run after all of them and in the end, get exhausted and get none. Running after the pabulum is known as e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1.\n\nIt\u2019s been told, \u201cAnanyamamata visnormamata brahamasamgata. \n\nInstead of running after several objects, run after Vi\u015b\u0144u and get Him because there is only one pabulum here. When more than one pabulum is there, the mind gets divided and none will be achieved. This goes on. \n\nWhen the e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is only one, the work will be done. When there are so many, the work will not be done at all. If one desires to take milk and smoke at once, it can\u2019t be possible. A man has to do either of these two. Hence the object of e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is Parama Purus\u0301a and nothing else.\n\nIn no case should humans be freed from e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1. Without e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 there will be disturbance. One has only to see the type of e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1. Where there is no e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1, there is annihilation of existence. Hence the existence of e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is essential. \n\nThe e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 for other objects has to be channelized towards Parama Purus\u0301a [Supreme Consciousness]. The correct e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is bhakti [devotion]. \n\nIf a man wants to become a devotee of the lord but in the mind of his mind, if he thinks that God will make him pass his examination \u2013 here the e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is not one but two. Here the work will not be done, \u201cI want Param\u00e1tman and from Him I want nothing\u201d. \n\nWhen something is demanded from God the e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 becomes two. Hence the time is completely wasted. Where this e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is towards Param\u00e1tman there it is known as devotion.When the e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is not for Param\u00e1tman but for something else, it is known as asakti [attachment].\n\nA s\u00e1dhaka [spiritual practitioner] who moves on speedily towards Parama Purus\u0301a will never be blind to the sufferings of numberless persons around him because of the lack of solid social system, solid economic system and the lack of humanity. If he is blind to the ill-management in the social system, he has not been able to understand Parama Purus\u0301a fully. When a devotee will move towards Parama Purus\u0301a his approach will be \u00c1tma moks\u00e1rtham jagat hit\u00e1ya ca [self-realization and service to humanity]. \n\nHe goes on moving towards Parama Purus\u0301a while serving the humanity. When the humanity is neglected, the \u00c1tma Mok\u015b\u00e1rtham [self-realization] is also destroyed. Hence he must be ready to serve the humanity.\n\n Therefore the s\u00e1dhakas who don\u2019t render social service don\u2019t have real devotion. In their devotion lies selfishness [Khudaparasti]. The devotees who are selfish don\u2019t attain God [Khuda]. Hence the correct e\u015ba\u0144\u00e1 is devotion. Those who are devotees are workers [Karmii]. They will never be afraid of the work. They will do maximum work. The Supreme Goal of human life is sam\u00e1dhi [merging of unit consciousness into Cosmic consciousness]. \n\nPeople are established in Shiva [Infinite Consciousness] sam\u00e1dhi by being guided by \u201c\u00c1tma mok\u015b\u00e1rtham jagat hit\u00e1ya ca\u201d. There is no other way out.\n\nShrii Shrii \u00c1nandam\u00fartiji \nparaphrased from Astitva and Shivatva\nSubha\u0301s\u0301ita Sam\u0301graha Part 20",

Different religions call it by different names and they believe that there is a divine essence that allows the body to go through this existence that we call \u201cLife\u201d from the moment we are born until we die, what happens then is not yet certain, in the course of our existence we meet people, we live adventures, we grow and learn, among the many souls with whom we happen to become traveling companions will establish bonds that may last for a day or forever, but what allows these encounters to be only casual or important? Who or what is it that makes us bond more with certain people than with others? It seems that the soul is capable of recognizing who is on the same wavelength as us, something that the mind is not capable of. Forty years have passed in this short adventure that we call \u201cLife\u201d and my body is beginning to show the first signs of rupture due to the inevitable expiration date that is part of this mystery that is the greatest adventure that we can live \u201cLife\u201d itself, two old friends have come to visit me and as always happens when we meet, time loses its importance, It stops, nothing seems to have changed since we were young and strong, our bodies have changed, aches, pains, intolerances, hair and beards a little gray, but the soul has not aged, the soul can not age but can accumulate experiences and mature, the soul is ageless and perhaps immortal, The Soul is capable of recognizing its fellows and with whom it is at ease, the body seems to be only a kind of shell that at some point will lose its usefulness and abandon us, but perhaps the Soul will continue in its adventure only under another form, I don\u2019t have an answer but I have no doubt that I have been fortunate to have met so many wonderful souls in these 40 years that have made this adventure a beautiful journey, I don\u2019t know when and how it will end but when my expiration date arrives I will be able to consider myself fortunate to have met special souls that have allowed this journey to be full of beautiful memories and unforgettable moments.",

Attachment means clinging to something or someone, becuase you found it fascinating, attractive, helpful, relaxing etc. all this is true in the sense of something, something dead ie your car, house, smarthphone, smoking, or anyother addiction. You are attached to a person, whether its a woman or a man becuase you have that feeling of loneliness. when you attached to someone, it brings fulfillment within you, or a sense of fulfillment within you. Not only that but it also comes with the anxiety, insecurities, fear, possessiveness, happiness, love, excitement, that creates the confusion of mind & heart. Its easy to get over when someone who don't wanna clinge to you or if she wants.but you are in the worse when the other person is on the fence. This creates a lot of confusion, you go through misery, and that feeling is the worse, it ruins your psychological state of mind. You have to pay a very heavy price just to be attached to someone. If you are attached, nothing works in this situation. you must have to face this situation no matter what. No understanding, no logical sense helps when you are attached to someone. Only time can heal these wounds. So, an intelligent individual, experience all these things, see the truth of it & get aware of all of these. He get that very sense from the very bottom of his heart that attachment only brings misery to his life. & he will never attached to something or someone in the future, becuase he is having this intense experience of attachment that brings misery, that makes him frightened when he even think of this. there is no way that one can go back to the same cycle and experience the same thing again. So, to summarize, if you are attached, there is no way going back from it, you must have to face it, you have to go through this misery. Feel the pain, feel that very psychological pain that it brings to you. Be hurt, physically and psychologically. Becuase it will become the base of your intelligece that won't make you attach ever.",

          "content": "Tasawwuf, commonly referred to as Sufism in the West, is neither a separate religion nor a sect within Islam. Tasawwuf can be described as the spiritual orientation of the heart in the pursuit of God. It thrives through practice, discipline, and diligence. Tasawwuf has its roots in Islam, with those closest to the Prophet Muhammad practicing it without formal nomenclature. Their primary sources of spirituality were the Quran and the Prophet's life.\n\nOver the centuries, many Tasawwuf practitioners and scholars structured its core practices into a formal discipline, giving it a name and developing a vocabulary to describe the spiritual journey, states, feelings, and phenomena. Even today, new terminology continues to evolve.\n\nSome Sufi scholars have gained quite a popularity in the West due to the availability of translated works. These scholars include Rumi, Ghazali, and Ibn Arabi. Unfortunately, nowadays, Tasawwuf often exists in name only, with its practices dwindling. Many people quote secondary or tertiary sources to make their points. While this has its place, it is crucial to strive for learning from primary sources.\n\nAs a spritual practice, tasawwuf is holistic, employing a variety of practices to aid the Salik (Seeker) on their journey. Commonly used practices include Zikr (Remembrance of God), Fikr (Reflection), and Muraqaba (Meditation). In tasawwuf, the meditation is not an end in itself, it is rather the means to the divine.\n\nA well-known Tasawwuf anecdote likens the spiritual path to climbing a mountain, where various trails exist. The person at the mountain's summit sees all trails. The Shaikh (Spiritual Guide) prescribes the best route for a Salik or Mureed (Determined Seeker). Thus, you'll find diverse practices within Sufi literature.\n\nFor those interested in embarking on this path, here are a couple of beginner techniques. You can start practicing some spiritual exercises today without converting or joining a Tariqa (School of Sufi Thought).\n\nGo for a solitary walk or a hike. With each step, silently invoke God's name, using the name you prefer (God, Allah, Dio, etc.). Say His name in your heart clearly and with focus; there's no need to be loud. As you walk, observe the workings of God's world. In nature, contemplate the winds, clouds, and the activities of birds. In an urban setting, reflect on the cycle of life\u2014birth, aging, and departure from this world. Everyone is busy with their roles.\n\nSaying God's name with each step is known as Zikr (Remembrance), while contemplating God's work is called Tafakkur (Contemplation).\n\nTry these practices and share your experiences.",

And no, I don\u2019t expect God to comment on this or for any of you to have the magic answer. \nI\u2019ve experienced psychosis once before. I thought that I was Jesus basically, and thought my family was out to kill me, poisoning my food, plotting on me in many specific ways. I thought everyone was demonic. I read the Bible but it only made it worse. I kept telling my dad that I didn\u2019t want help from people, I just needed God. Since then, I\u2019ve been really good at distracting myself. But now, the distractions are gone and I\u2019m on the brink of insanity. Mostly revolving around spirituality. I don\u2019t know who God is anymore. Or where to find him. I can\u2019t read the Bible anymore, it makes me more scared and doesn\u2019t speak to me how it used to. So many people have put their perspectives and opinions into my mind, I have no discernment at all anymore. It\u2019s like my mind has evaporated. I\u2019m like, numb. It\u2019s hard to talk about it out loud. Everything feels demonic, even me. I trust no one. I turned away from God in 2020 and haven\u2019t heard or felt him since. I\u2019m alone. Every sound, word, everything- is overwhelming and being twisted into something dark. Im having delusional thoughts but can kind of work through them. I\u2019m conscious of it but I\u2019m scared of losing grip again. Should I check myself into a mental hospital? I\u2019m literally supposed to work in the morning. This is torture. I have no peace. To my family or friends it seems I\u2019m doing fine, just depressed and anxious. I feel like a therapist won\u2019t understand me.",

Is anhedonia a byproduct of not having materialistic goals?\n\nMy 2 modes seem to be aching boring nothingness and utter despair. I wake up. I think \"what could/should I do with this day?\" And there is nothing. Have breakfast, wash, do a bit of cleaning, organising, stare out the window, at the wall. After being awake for an hour I've done everything I need to do and I could just go back to bed. Typically if I read, watch or listen to something I start falling asleep anyway. I've been stuck here for 5 years after a complicated loss.\n\nIt feels like the path of my life is the same of each day. I'm just waiting to sleep. I'm not chasing a dream. I'm not having children. I don't want to depend on stuff or events for peace or god forbid, joy. And I'm not shackling an innocent soul into this existence for my own sense of purpose.\n\nSomewhere I know life isn't about what I want. I should help people, or something. Volunteer. But I'm not reliable, even to myself. I've had multiple friends give up on me because I can't get out of the house when it's time to meet up. I usually manage one meal a day, the rest I pass on because I don't really feel worth the short time holding myself upright, making and cleaning up. Hunger isn't really that painful in comparison.\n\nI appreciate this is a jumble but if the crux of this rings any bells, and you have got to another side of wishing you didn't have to be here, what's a good place to start? I've had 2 years of therapy, it helps in the moment but on the whole I've not found a way or reason for things to change.",

Suicide is a theme during these infrequent occasions and while I'm not remotely suicidal outside of these episodes, in those moments I contemplate it seriously (not as an immediate action, but more as a legitimate option at some undefined point in the future). \n\nHowever several times now, in the midst of a dark spiral of hopelessness, I have felt the most incredible love and comfort envelop me, putting an immediate stop to the despair. Like every cell in my body is infused with some essence of love. It happens immediately, like flipping a switch. It's not like my thoughts gradually get less dark and I work my own way out of the pit; I am suddenly lifted out and thereafter incapable of feeling bad even if I try. I can think the same thoughts that were, moments previously, like daggers to my soul but they have no effect. I am suddenly within an impenetrable bubble of love. It's happened 3 or 4 times now. It doesn't happen every time I'm sad or spiraling, but comes only in my very darkest of moments. \n\nAnyway I want to know if this remarkable energy is coming from God, a guardian angel, a departed loved one or, in my most hopeful of fantasies, a soul mate whom I've yet to meet but am connected to in another plane.",

I am a white queer American male who really has no connection to any traditional spiritual practices. I grew up going to a non-denominational church, so I guess I have experience with being religious even though Christianity never really clicked with me. I guess my concern is that I don't know where to start. I don't know where my identity would really fit in a way that isn't culturally insensitive or disingenuous, I guess. I feel like in America specifically, white spiritual communities are largely, well, white. I feel like this in of itself is contradictory of the inclusive practices that they are doing. I don't really know how to articulate what I mean but I guess where does one begin a spiritual journey when their identity has been historically discriminative of the very cultural practices I am trying to learn from. I hope this makes sense to somebody lmao.",

Surely I am separate from  all these average people supporting Israel's latest bombing campaign in Gaza and spreading propaganda that has been repeatedly debunked without guilt. Surely I am separate from people who partake in history revisionism to justify the ethnic cleansing of my people. Surely I am made of something different than the people who do not flinch at the deaths of 20K people in the span of 2 months. Surely I will not end up in the same place as these people?\n\nIt's becoming so hard to cope with reality, and I've never really believed in the idea of heaven or hell, but recently I have been finding myself hanging on to this concept to continue existing as normal. I can't fathom that this is life. I can't come to terms with the fact that the filth I've been witnessing, as it is now more apparent than ever. It is seriously weighing down on me. \n\nIs hell real? If hell isn't real, are we in hell? If so, why is it hell for us and not for the politician being bribed to vote against a ceasefire? If not, will there be hell? Will these people feel the wrath of the terror they encouraged and provoked?\n\nPS: Please do not engage in a political debate with me. I am not here for this. I have my own opinion and the information is plenty and out there. I know the history of the formation of the Zionist Entity in detail, I have read countless of books from both Israeli and Palestinian historians, scholars, artists and other authors, I am of Levantine descent  and was raised by parents who were victim to the war crimes of Israel back in our ancestral homes, and I have had the misfortune of having to escape Israel's 2006 bombing campaign in Lebanon.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing what everybody thinks.",

But everything in our body, every cell of our body is nothing but energy. What is this energy? It is the energy of the Soul. It is the energy of the supreme, SIP, the Supreme Immortal Power. Everything that is growing in us is nothing but, the supreme power, the energy, which can be called Soul.\r  \n\r  \n",

What should one do when one feels lonely (physically amd mentally/spiritually)? I mean like for long times and I also don't mean superficial relationships. \n\nMaybe to clarify: I can spot and handle some of my desires to be unimportant so to say. Like for example wanting a new object like a new clothes/shoes/electronics or fancy foods etc. I have not a big problem to recognize this and not give in to those desires so to say. Fortunately I also have enough food, water, shelter and kind ppl around me. So I don't have a lack of those and an unmanagble desire for those things. But I am very lonely and very few not to say no close friends/a partner or something similar. And I feely my body and mind don't like that. My spiritual side has probably not so much a problem with it except that it doesn't know how to handle these deisres and the desperation and selfhatred and sadness that are caused by the fact that I see no chance of ever/or at least until now meet someone with whom I would have compatible chemistry.\nI also wonder, there are ppl whi never even can find colleagues or so, what would one recommend them to do?

I was really holding back as I didn't want to at that moment. I finally gave in cause I was just too tired to fight it and I thought maybe it was something I was being asked to do by my spirit guides. It felt really dizzy and I was pushed back to my body quickly. Wasn't peaceful at all.\n\nThen, tonight, as I was getting asleep, I started hearing in three different occasions (like being there in first person), a scene of abuse towards a woman, a bombing in civilian zone and another scene I can't really remember now.\n\nI'm not scared of these experiences but I'd like to know if it's normal and how could I help/manage if someone there is connecting to my energy.\n\nThanks in advance and excuse my broken English. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

Meaning eternity to us would more than likely be vastly different to him. So I wonder if we will all view time as HE does some day. If so, then that makes sense, because the punishment would simply be a punishment rather than torture. What are your thoughts on this?

I have this Ahaa moment.\n\nI'm like, the piece of information/knowledge was the same on both the days, but why didn't I get the Ahaa moment the other day?\n\nIs free will involved in it? \n\nCan one understand by forcing or does it happen when one surrenders to the situation and be in complete acceptance of reality? \n\nIf so,I keep coming back to free will again. Some days I feel like acceptance is a choice. But some days I feel like there are other forces that are in act and it feels like decisions are made for me.",

          "score": 7,
          "author": "bobobrott",
          "content": "Are me (29M) and my girlfriend (27F) incompatible?\n\nMe (29M) and my girlfriend (27F) have been dating for 2 years, and now that a potential engagement is on the table, I've been doubting whether I chose the right partner. She's very practical and I have a strong spiritual side that I would like reflected in my partner.\n\n  \nNeither of us was looking for marriage when we first started dating so I didn't even have my antennas on for whether she's wife material back then. We wanted something casual originally but then feelings grew and we fell into a relationship and adapted to each other.\n\n  \nThe good thing is I was originally attracted for the right reasons - she's mild mannered, attractive, grounded in the real world, has a well-paying job like me, and we dream of a similar future.\n\n  \nHowever I always felt there was something missing for me - she sees the world through a very literal, logical lens, while I often like to sense things through my body/emotions, and I want to integrate more eastern teachings into my lifestyle. I've always swept this under the rug, but now I'm transitioning to a career in the wellness industry and I'm meeting a lot of people who experience the world in the same way as I do, and I realize it's a big void in my relationship and in my life that I've yearned for strongly.\n\n  \nI've tried to see if my girlfriend would be into spirituality , and she's open to taking some classes with me and supporting my journey, but it's not a core part of her identity like it is for mine. She understands when I break things down for her into scientific steps, but if I go into more abstract concepts like having her sense her awareness and the aliveness in her body, she has this clueless look in her eye unless I break it down like a math problem. And then at that point it becomes a concept rather than an experience.\n\n  \nI've often daydreamed about if a girl who's into Buddhism and yoga would be a better match for me, but I'm trying to talk myself out of it because I love my girlfriend and I don't want to abandon what we've built. At the same time I don't know if this relationship is what's best for me long term. I long for someone who values a lifestyle of self-awareness practices and co-creates an environment like that with me. I'm also less interested in sex with my girlfriend these past months because our sex is only physical. She thinks we can compartmentalize our careers and have external friends who share our interests, but I'm noticing I want spirituality to pervade into my relationship more and more.\n\n  \nIs this just a case of the halo effect/grass is greener syndrome, or could it be an actual incompatibility?\n\n  \nTL;DR - Dating for 2 years, considering engagement, but strong doubts arise. Girlfriend is very scientific, while I seek a more spiritual connection. Initially, I wasn't dating for marriage, and the practical aspects attracted me, but now I feel a void and diminished sexual attraction. Girlfriend is open to exploring spirituality but it's not a part of her identity and has hard time grasping it. I daydream of a partner into Buddhism and yoga. Unsure if it's a case of grass is greener or actual incompatibility.",

When your third eye is open, you can hear music without having to listen to it. Because the sound is stored in your memories.\nThat\u2019s awesome. But the next part scared me. I then started hearing my mom\u2019s voice whispering all sorts of subliminal messages. I couldn\u2019t make out what the messages were saying because they were coming in so fast it was like 30 voices all at once. At first the voices were kinda quiet, but then they got \u2018closer\u2019 and louder.

          "content": "My current partner and I have been together for about 2.5 years and honestly, about a year ago our sex life took a bit of a plunge. \n\nThat is not uncommon for me - every longer term relationship I\u2019ve had, has plateaued around the year mark and I\u2019ll usually break up with them around the 1.5 year mark because I feel nagged by them for wanting sex and I don\u2019t want it. \n\nI have been going through a big ol\u2019 healing journey this year though and have already begun to reap the rewards slowly but surely (better mental health, less avoidant, more clear-headed and grounded, protecting my energy etc) \n\nI hoped that I\u2019d see similar positive outcomes for my sexual appetite, but no such luck at all\u2026\n\nI recognise that I have more shadow work to do, but feel I need a push in the right direction. What should I focus on? What questions may steer me in the right direction?\n\nI love my partner very much, they\u2019ve been my rock since we began dating and it saddens me that I am not satisfying them nor myself. I find myself envious of others who have high sexual appetites, seem very much still into their partners sexually after years together, and am tired of repeating this cycle over and over again. \n\nSome things that may add some needed context:\n\u2022 I grew up with emotionally immature parents. \n(I did not receive consistent emotional support, my parents could not emotionally regulate causing me to become hyper vigilant, insecurely attached and deprived of emotional connection from a young age) \n\u2022 My parents very rarely showed intimacy toward each other from what I saw/see. \n\u2022 I have been sexually assaulted in my life. \n\u2022 Energy wise \u2014 Three separate times now, I have had a partner or just someone I\u2019ve had sex with before, seemingly try to have sex with me while they\u2019re sleeping. Like, I have been woken up by them either climbing onto me and trying to have sex with me or rubbing themselves on me incessantlyyyyyyy, and they have been completely asleep\u2026 The first time it was my boyfriend at the time and he was mortified and ashamed. The second time it was just a friend who was sleeping in the same bed as me (but we had slept together before) and he also seemed surprised by it - I concluded for him that he was a sketch bag and haven\u2019t spoke to him since! But, now that it has happened again with my current partner (and they were also shocked to hear it happened and seemed grossed out by themselves for doing that, and having no recollection of it) So, after a third time in my life - I feel like maybe something more is happening here energetically?? \n\nDoes anyone out there have any insight into this? What may be going on? How I might best go about working with my shadow on this? \n\nI feel like once my partners don\u2019t get as much sex from me, they become needy for it which repulses me even more and I lose attraction for them altogether. But, I genuinely want to break this pattern. I have had good chats with my partner about our sex life lots, they know about my history of sexual abuse and borderline emotional neglect as a child. They are a very patient, beautiful partner, and I love them and want to start a family with them one day. But, it\u2019s getting harder to truly visualise that now when we are having these issues that have been coming up for me for a longggg time\u2026 I don\u2019t want to lose my current partner because I am not finding my way to healing\n\nAll advice and anecdotes welcomed!",

Not just in the classic dismissal of hippies \u201cohh I love you all we are all the same in some way\u201d, but in a \u201cYOU ARE GOD/SOURCE\u201d way.  If you\u2019re heavily religious and choose not to consider other perspectives, time to click off this post. \ud83d\ude09 Maybe it\u2019s just too bad the universe is infinite and I constantly keep slipping into linear timelines/present moments in which everyone is ASLEEP \ud83d\ude34.(aka, the people who are confused/ call me crazy/ tell me to lay off the wacky-sauce in the comments.) These versions of myself I speak about actually believes that they are their body/ego/identity, and therefore fears death/ or feels the need to \u201cprepare\u201d for the terrible, terrible future to come. If that\u2019s you, so be it- that\u2019s your trip, man. Keep living that perspective if that\u2019s what you so enjoy- a fear based viewpoint. If only you would see that there are infinite \u201cparallel\u201d realities just as real as this one now. And it splits infinitely, depending on if it is \u201cobserved\u201d, and both universes are observed, creating the split. And subsequently, Wildly different variables go into the result of the linear world you are perceiving now. \n\n\nSo of COURSE God smites the whole world if it gets too bad, it\u2019s INEVITABLE due to FREE WILL & INFINITY. \n\nIn this way, what you BELIEVE will happen, WILL HAPPEN. It\u2019s all God. You are God. It is all One! The sacred books have been telling this us for years. We have the internet, and yet- no one feels connected to eachother. Do you not recognize the beautiful expressions of self in all the languages? Just because it\u2019s a different language/ culture doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s EVIL\u2026 (looking at you, Muslims, Christians)  Excuse my English.  I\u2019m done typing this out. By this point I\u2019m just expressing my frustration towards the versions of myself who try to call other people evil or going to hell simply for having a different way of life. Isn\u2019t that so comical. YOU ARE that other person. Why are you so blinded by your individuality? LOVE THEM. ACCEPT THEM.  (Still speaking to myself)\n\nThis multiverse will not be commonly known until later on. If you\u2019re reading this from the future, and quantum physics many worlds theory is somehow proved- then hello. (Which, it will happen. Since it\u2019s infinite. This is the way god woke. This is the way God is able to do miracles. Jesus was 5D and beyond, mf\u2019s. He let us off easy. We could put on a real show if we all believed and knew what we were capable of. But there\u2019s so many of us in this linear reality. So",

          "content": "# The Seeker and the mysterious Stranger (Part 3 of 7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Love will change the world**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cListen man, I want to be honest with you,\u201d the **Seeker** says to the **mysterious stranger**. Both are sitting on their bench, deep in a forest.\n\n\u201cYou know... I am tired... Utterly exhausted. Everyday, is a day of struggle. After every achievement, reality kicks in and I am crushed by Life. One challenge after the other. So many problems to fix, so many battles to win. Everything just seems... so shallow... so meaningless.\n\nFirst you go to school, then perhaps higher education, get a job, get married, raise your children, climb the career ladder, then your children move out, then retirement and after couple of years you die lonely in a nursery home... And I ask myself, is that all that there is to Life? A constant struggle to fit in with the expectations of society? Why do I still get out of bed everyday?\n\nLife has let me down, humanity has let me down. Whenever I read the news, I just get sad, angry or disgusted. Everyone knows how fucked up the world is... We are all aware of what's going on. All these terrible things happening... And I am just tired with it, that's all. Disappointed with life itself. And Yet, all I ever wanted is to be happy...\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe **mysterious stranger** looks at the **Seeker** with empathetic eyes.\n\n\u201cLet me ask you Seeker, if you had the power to change the world, what kind of world would you envision?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d answers the **Seeker**, yawning. \u201cPerhaps a world, that is peaceful, without any wars. Perhaps a world, free of environmental pollution. A world free of prejudices and biases of any kind. A world of joy and laughter. A world of bliss. A world of Freedom and unity. Where we share our food, instead of fighting over oil. I just want a world, where I can be myself without being judged or taken advantage of. A world, that allows me to be happy.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cLet me tell you a secret,\u201d the **mysterious stranger** grins. \u201cEveryone dreams of such a world. Doesn't matter where they live, doesn't matter what they do. On the deepest level, this is what all of us actually want. Even those who are fully consumed by hatred... Even they long deep within, for such a world.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe **Seeker** scratches their forehead:\n\n\u201cBut... If everyone supposedly dreams of such a society, then explain to me, why we are unable to change it.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cThat is a very long story,\u201d the **mysterious stranger** smirks.\n\n\u201cI will tell it to you, when you visit my hut. But for a short answer: We don't change the world because we don't believe, that we can. We think it's impossible... Because this is all we ever knew. But what if I tell you, that ***there is a way***? What if I tell you, that it is in fact possible. Close your eyes and imagine it. Can you see it? A world, where people are dancing on the street, singing a song of liberation. A world, where old enemies drink together as friends. Can you hear the song, that resounds deep within the heart of every human being? Can you feel it? The wind of change blowing into your face.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe **Seeker** blows some air from their nose. \u201cTss... And how do you suppose, we achieve this? Through a revolution? We all know how well this worked out in the past... Or do you propose a reformation, a couple of social programs... You think, this will change the world?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe **mysterious stranger** burst out in laughter:\n\n\u201cCertainly, this won't change anything. You can't fight violence with violence. You can't fight separation through further separation. No, you can't change the world through any ideologies or political action.\n\nNow what is it in ourselves, that is needed most in these times? What is it, that can wipe away all of our tears, all of our suffering, our anguish and our hate... What is it, that can break the cycle of destruction? What is it, that can free us from the prison, that we ourselves have created?\n\nThe answer, my friend, is LOVE. ***LOVE will change this world***. LOVE is a force that cannot be stopped. All shadows vanish, when you shine the light of love on it. You can't grasp it, it is neither yours or mine. LOVE is there for everyone and anyone. \u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cLove?!\u201d The **Seeker** asks in disbelief. \u201cThis is like the most stereotypical answer you can give. How should love itself transform the world?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d admits the **mysterious stranger**. \u201cIt's not that simple. You see, throughout the Ages, the meaning behind the word 'Love' was corrupted. Wrongly defined by many. We have lost it a long time ago. I say, it's about time, that we find it again. Love in its purest form. Once you have found it, you will understand. And you will see the power in it. You will see, the ripples that it sends out, from person to person.\u201d\n\nThe **Seeker** shakes their head, laughing. \u201cYou are spouting nonsense. I have never before heard such bullshit in my life. It won't make any difference if a single person changes. The world will remain fucked up.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe face of the **mysterious stranger** lights up in excitement:\n\n\u201cDon't you see it, my friend? Your influence on the collective is so much greater, than you can even imagine. Your thoughts, emotions, words and actions affect your entire sphere of influence, which is interconnected with the rest of the world. One light flaring up can suffice, to illuminate an entire room. LOVE may be hard to find, hard to see, as we are all so caught up in our prisons and illusions. But it just needs one person, to find true, unconditional Love... If one person changes their outlook on life; this will reflect on the collective consciousness. Change yourself and you change the world. ***For you are the world and the world is you.***\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cUtter bullshit,\u201d the **Seeker** spouts.\n\n\u201cIf I behave compassionate, someone else will take advantage of me. If I don't take what I want, someone else will take it. If I show weakness, I will lose. So why should I give up my sense of self, if this leads to regrets? Even if I were to 'transform' myself, there is always someone out there to hurt me. I have been hurt enough in my life to know, what humans are capable of.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cPlease tell me, dear Seeker,\u201d the **mysterious stranger** asks in a serious tone. \u201c***Why are you so afraid of love***?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TO BE CONTINUED**\n\nfor more content visit: r/We_Are_Humanity",

Any problem that she encounters in her life, I am so quick to try to fix it and make her feel better. There are periods where I stop doing that, and just accept that it is her path to walk and not mine, and all I should do is just love her. Unfortunately those times go quickly, and I go back to trying to fix her situation when she doesn't ask me too. Funny enough, this exhausts me, and I build resentment toward her for something she didn't even do. She can notice this. We have had arguments about it and every one we have makes it seem perfectly clear to the both of us that it is my problem and not hers. I often bottle things up, until they come out and wreck havick. When I let go of my empathy, I stop trying to control and fix everything, I just accept.\n\nSo, as a young man how can I just let go and let be without attaching to another person's challenges in life?",

          "content": "Souls\nBy Alessandro Carosi\n\n\nWhat allows our body to move, feel emotions, love? Different religions call it by different names and they believe that there is a divine essence that allows the body to go through this existence that we call \u201cLife\u201d from the moment we are born until we die, what happens then is not yet certain, in the course of our existence we meet people, we live adventures, we grow and learn, among the many souls with whom we happen to become traveling companions will establish bonds that may last for a day or forever, but what allows these encounters to be only casual or important? Who or what is it that makes us bond more with certain people than with others? It seems that the soul is capable of recognizing who is on the same wavelength as us, something that the mind is not capable of. Forty years have passed in this short adventure that we call \u201cLife\u201d and my body is beginning to show the first signs of rupture due to the inevitable expiration date that is part of this mystery that is the greatest adventure that we can live \u201cLife\u201d itself, two old friends have come to visit me and as always happens when we meet, time loses its importance, It stops, nothing seems to have changed since we were young and strong, our bodies have changed, aches, pains, intolerances, hair and beards a little gray, but the soul has not aged, the soul can not age but can accumulate experiences and mature, the soul is ageless and perhaps immortal, The Soul is capable of recognizing its fellows and with whom it is at ease, the body seems to be only a kind of shell that at some point will lose its usefulness and abandon us, but perhaps the Soul will continue in its adventure only under another form, I don\u2019t have an answer but I have no doubt that I have been fortunate to have met so many wonderful souls in these 40 years that have made this adventure a beautiful journey, I don\u2019t know when and how it will end but when my expiration date arrives I will be able to consider myself fortunate to have met special souls that have allowed this journey to be full of beautiful memories and unforgettable moments.",

          "author": "NecessarySocrates",
          "content": "I used to think that Buddhism was so lame because of the idea of \"letting go of desire\". Like how exactly am I supposed to enjoy life if I don't want to do anything?\n\n\nBut it's not desire that's the problem, it's the *attachment* to desire. We're addicted to desire because from a young age we get beaten down by external forces in the world that are beyond our control, and then our default state becomes unhappiness, and then we learn to require external things in order to momentarily satisfy our egos and become temporarily happy. *Healthy desire* arises once we realize that our default state is actually *supposed* to be happiness, pure happiness and peace, and we can then act from this place of internal happiness to enjoy the world and seek the things we're truly interested in from a place of abundance and genuine excitement rather than desperation and scarcity. Others will sense our positive genuine attitude and be attracted to it. It's like the \"law of attraction\", in a sense.\n\n\n\"Letting go of desire\" is the act of observing your own ego from a higher vantage point. It's understanding that your emotions are just temporary worldly feelings and there is a higher plane of awareness and understanding from within where you can control these emotions so that you don't have to be a slave to them. \"Letting go\" is simple, but it's not easy. You really have to sit with your own emotions and take a deep dive to try to understand where they're coming from. Mindfulness meditation and therapy have helped me a lot with this.\n\n\nUltimately it's important to understand that even though we're all just flawed apes, we have the capacity to observe our own egos from a higher plane of understanding. Call that \"plane\" whatever you want... The Absolute, God, Brahman, Allah, Yahweh, the Universe, whatever, but understand that no matter happens in this physical world, there is always peace in this purest form of consciousness that your mind can tap into. After all, the purpose of life is to experience it and enjoy it, not to be a slave to your worldly ego. Hope that all makes sense.",

I didn\u2019t feel peace like yesterday, I felt authority, like it was something stronger than me that needed me to listen.\n\nI climbed the hill, and today I kneeled in the groove rather than sitting. It felt wrong to just sit, I bowed my head and meditated. But, my headphones didn\u2019t cut out. \n\nAfter a while I figured it was just some stupid thing, and went to leave. But first I looked up at the sky. \n\nThe shape of the hill had been cut out of the cloudy night sky, even weirder was that directly above me, the shape of the groove has been cut out of the clouds. \n\nOn one end of the hill in the sky there was the shape of a person, and directly opposite them was a dog, I was with my dog since I walk her to this park every night.\n\nAt first I didn\u2019t notice this part, but off to the side there were two other shapes, two horned people. One had two heads and was holding a sickle, and the other had two horns, but it was only half a person, one horn was floating. Positioned between the creatures and the hill was the shape of a bow and arrow, which was pointed at me.\n\nThe sky was otherwise covered in clouds, and these shapes weren\u2019t there only two minutes before I got there. It felt like some kind of warning seeing the creatures, but I\u2019m not sure of what.",

I went through a bad breakup in which i had been cheated on my whole relationship. i had two abortions. i was struggling a lot. I even had to end my friendships because they just didn\u2019t align with me anymore. I had been taking life really serious as in putting work into healing. I transformed my entire life. I\u2019m now pescatarian, i work out 4 days a week, journal, meditate, sun gaze, take care of my mental health, quit social media, even went celibate and quit smoking. I get to school and it\u2019s temptations all around me. I started smoking occasionally then i started smoking a little more. A guy i had said a few words with at the gym came to me at the dining hall and asked for my instagram but i didnt have any and he kinda was acting like it was foreign to not have any socials and that should\u2019ve been my first sign. Then he asked to come over and he offered to smoked. We hung out the first time and just chilled. The second time we hung out we had sex. I cried after. I was so devastated i broke my celibacy.i woke up and i told him we needed a break from having sex cus i literally woke up depressed and i think i absorbed his energy and he said \u201cWe can stop having sex but who\u2019s depressed?\u201d I was just like\ud83d\ude10. Anyways i guess my question is\u2026 do you possibly have any words of wisdom for me or like any advice on just sticking to my path and staying single. I have a huge issue with hyper sexuality and risky sexual behavior. and i just felt like i fell back into old patterns i thought i already grew out of. i just want advice.",

What would YOU do in this situation?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to learn from a new teacher I've found, because I believe the info he's sharing may be helpful for continuing my growth (spiritual, etc.).\n\nHowever, I keep having misgivings about the person based on his attitude and the attitude of his associate who he creates content with.\n\nTo be frank, something about him just bothers me. I don't agree with cancel culture and the modern sport of being offended by everything, but part of me finds this person offensive enough to give me moderate pause.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**He sometimes comes across, for lack better terms, as potentially racist, ableist, and anti-feminist. And maybe even a bit arrogant? I know, I know, none of these things are crimes.**\n\n**Note: I'm not claiming that he is any of these things, but what I have heard from him and what I've read that he has written leads me, personally, to these conclusions.**\n\n**Another note: I'm no social justice warrior. I just think people should be treated with decency unless they do something to warrant otherwise.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to \"expose\" this person in anyway.\n\nI feel my issues with the things he says are personal. I'm not trying to shame anybody here. In fact, I could even be wrong in my assessment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But I will say that in a communication he sent today, he used the \"r\\*\\*\\*\\*d\" word to describe another human being who he considered \"mentally challenged\".**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't believe the use of this word alone is a huge flag (depending on how and why its used), but I'm adding this word choice to other things that he has said, and my own general feeling of *ugh* that I get from him.\n\nEXTRA DETAILS, SKIP IF YOU WANT: Now why do I get an *ugh* feeling? I suppose... I feel like he acts as part of a \"club\" that requires \"immutable\" characteristics to join. Further, people who aren't part of that \"club\" are inherently valued as less than \"club members\".\n\nDid that make any sense? Here's another example: I think it could be possible, that if I were to become his student and say, join in a zoom class with my camera on, he might--just might--treat me differently than, for example, a man, or someone who may look or act the way he does, and who therefore has better automatic rapport with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Also, I have tried to seek out the techniques that he's sharing elsewhere, but I have not found a workable alternative source.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this matter?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Is this a case of get in, get what you need, and get out?\n* Could the reservations that I have possibly mean that I need to stay far, far away?\n* Perhaps I'm just seeing the situation wrong or reading into things that aren't there?\n\nEXTRA DETAILS, SKIP IF YOU WANT: I had a short correspondence with him once and I found a comment that he had made to me to be what I considered... borderline offensive? I can take dirty jokes. After years of hearing such jokes and other double entendre, I can make a few of my own. So I'm no snow white angel here. But with email correspondence, nobody has ever made such a comment to me, and I've had correspondences with many, many other people. Never been told anything like that before and it made me feel \"ugh\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I really want to learn the information he teaches. Otherwise, I'm 98% sure I would have already completely distanced myself.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think? What would you do in this situation?\n\nThanks for reading.",

Suddenly I felt coming back\nto a normal state because I also fell in love with my current boyfriend. The normal feeling lasted a year and then I was hit by a giant depression that made me suicidal again  and I started seeing a shrink who prescribed me fluoxetine, which saved me. I started practising yoga and I was feeling so good that I pursued a dream I had: becoming a yoga teacher. I finished my training now. I stopped taking fluoxetine 1 year ago because me and my doctor thought I was able to go off. I had a normal year, kinda numb but stable and now I am feeling more and more depressed every day. It makes me worried because I know that this state was the beggining of all my heavy depressions.. I have my spirituality process now but even that is making me depressed. I turned 26 a few days ago, I am unemployed, am unemployed artist since I graduated which is tiring. My friends are boring. Everything is boring and I dont know what to do. I dont wanna go back to meds but I am so numb that I dont feel alive anymore.",

Same room we have as our room to be specific. So already there\u2019s a pretty high chance of spiritual activity. We know for sure there\u2019s loads of spirits on this property. I\u2019m a medium but haven\u2019t learned to much about how to control it and work with it to be of much help here. There\u2019s a couple spirits that hang out in the house and i do believe one is his. It\u2019s for sure a male 25-30 or so but that\u2019s all i know. He passed at 34 so i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s him. We have items get moved, fall, random headaches, tapping on windows, vultures outside, electronics turn on and off randomly, dead animals at our door occasionally just all kinds of signs of spirits but nothing directly harmful. \n\nHere\u2019s the question! I was cleaning today and lit some incense (dragons blood to be specific) and instantly got a huge migraine. Could the spirits be part of the reason why? Are they upset i did that maybe?

          "content": "I've been interesting in Spirituality for about 14 years. I've always been fascinated by such topics and everything. One thing that really bums me out is that I'll probably never be able to have any type of spiritual experience due to having aphantasia. \n\nFor those of you that don't know what aphantasia is it's the complete lack of a mind's eye. If I do have a mind's eye it's completely blind. For example when I read a book I only see words. I can understand what's going on and such but it all just reads like data to me. The book doesn't turn into a movie. I don't even have pictures or anything show up just words. I've done many guided meditations over the years and when they say things like \"visualize yourself on a beach\" I don't have anything come up. When I meditate all I see is blackness and there is an abyss of never ending thoughts. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if I didn't have severe ADD and rumination on top of this. \n\nIt's just annoying how most spiritual stuff requires visualization and imagination when I don't have that. I tried lucid dreaming and astral projection for countless years and never got anywhere with it. The furthest I got was the rare 30 second dream that was very random and hard to make out. I've been trying to do manifesting for so many years. I've been following Neville Goddard and everything and trying out his techniques but none of them work for me. \n\nDue to having aphantasia anything spirituality related is going to be impossible. I'll never get to astral project, never going to lucid dream, never going to channel, and never going to be able to manifest. For me I'll never get to do anything of this sort aside from reading about it. I know people are going to say that spirituality is more than those things and that is true but still it's annoying that due to my condition I'll never be able to do any of this stuff. I'm to the point where I will probably just throw in the towel and live life as it is and not worry about anything spiritual. I suppose if the spirit world is real I can at least experience spirituality on the other side when I pass on. ",

Awakening is simply realizing our true nature: the felt sense that we are the cosmos, and the cosmos is us. This truth opens our heart to flowing love. It liberates us from our cramped personal identities. We become capable of immense compassion, free from attachment, and directly connected to the sacred nature of the universe. It is the central teaching of all mystical traditions.   \nBut truly believing\u2014and living\u2014this truth can be frightening and destabilizing.   \nA spiritual emergence can lead to what Stan Groff called a \"spiritual emergency.\"In an attempt to make sense of my own experience, I began seeking out and speaking to people who have had awakening experiences.They are far more common than I previously thought, and they can be far more challenging and destabilizing than I imagined.  \nThree people I spoke with entered into psyche wards as a result of their awakening. One person experienced weeks to months of debilitating, nightmarish disillusionment. Saeed Khan, a consciousness teacher I spoke with, described how his awakening led to a prolonged state of clarity, after which he fell into intense depression before stabilizing himself. (I've had my own struggles integrating my experience, and I am grateful to Saeed and a few close friends for supporting me in challenging moments.)  \nSaeed introduced me to the term \"stable awakening,\" and I feel like that hits the nail on the head. Stability is what's missing in discussions of awakening, and in the global spiritual culture more broadly.Moving forward, I am committing to speak openly and clearly about my experience of awakening. This is for two reasons:  \n1. Living from a place of awakened consciousness may be the single most important shift we can make in our lives and for our world.  \n2. This shift can be immensely confusing and difficult without support.  \nThe mental health system (and psychology in general) aims to create ego-stability. It has virtually no frameworks for ego-transcendence, and as a result pathologizes awakening / emergence. According to Christina and Stanislav Grof:... many of the conditions, which are currently diagnosed as psychotic and indiscriminately treated by suppressive medication, are actually difficult stages of a radical personality transformation and of spiritual opening. If they are correctly understood and supported, these psychospiritual crises can result in emotional and psychosomatic healing, \\[and\\] remarkable psychological transformation.   \nPsychology tries to strengthen and secure the ego. And while strengthening the ego is a valuable first step to transcending the ego, it only gets us so far.   \nAs a result of my experience, a focus of my work has become studying and helping others achieve stable awakening or stabilize an awakening they're already going through.I've helped several people navigate difficult awakening experiences. In particular, those who come from non-religious backgrounds or who may not seek out traditional Buddhist, Hindu, or non-dual religious teachers. I am not a spiritual master, but I can offer psychological and spiritual tools that will better prepare people for and stabilize an awakening.  \nIf you or someone you know is going through a difficult awakening experience and are looking for some help, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to be a resource for those who need it. I can also connect you with other enlightenment teachers, like Saeed and others, whom I've worked with and trust.  \nAs Ram Dass said, 'we are all just walking each other home.'  \n",

          "content": "I was an RN for 42 years, 17 years as a Hospice RN and 5 of those years I worked inpatient Pediatric Hospice in a 10 bed facility caring for newborn to 17 year old terminally ill patients.   This was one of the most memorable patients for me professionally and personally for the vast amount of love that was shared between the family and myself.\n\nI worked in an AIDS inpatient unit very early 1990s.  One patient was a lovely woman who had given the disease to her husband and 1.5 year old son.  The mother was so sick and treatment was so scarce for the disease back then it was a death sentence.  There was a 5 year old daughter that tested negative and was to be the only member of that family to survive so the mother, so sick, did what she could to spend time with her daughter to have memories of her mom as she grew up alone.\n\nThat mother was a saint, I'd have to give her so much medication for nausea so every day after school the daughter could eat with her mom.  Mom died very quickly, then the little boy then then father.  The girl went to live with her grandmother.  Our AIDS unit closed due to funding and I moved on to another Hospice working with terminally ill children.  I worked night shift and when I came in one evening I was told we had a little girl with AIDS, my mind went back to this family years ago.  When I walked into her room I recognized the grandmother and there in the bed was the little girl that was to survive as she tested HIV negative, she had converted later.  Testing was still in its infancy at that time.\n\nThe little girl told me to let her cat in the room.  Her grandmother said she had no cat, but the girl insisted Oscar was waiting for her outside the glass door.  I opened the door and in came a black cat, jumped up on the bed and curled up with the little girl.  The grandmother said she had no cat.  It was Hospice, she loved the cat and the cat loved her so we let Oscar stay.  He would come every night and leave in the morning.  I had such a strong feeling this was not just a cat but some strong spiritual being there to comfort the little girl, now the last of her family dying.  I even spoke to the cat, \"you're not a real cat are you?\"  I'd get a strange and wise look from Oscar and felt that I was in the presence of pure love.  Was this an angel, her mother, both???\n\nThe night she died, shortly after midnight, Oscar stayed with her just a few minutes after she passed then left, he never came back, we never saw him before or after.  I think Oscar was there to help the little girl through the tough transition into her next life, and left with the little girl's spirit.  What an honor to be in that presence.   Over the years I was the Hospice RN for all 4 family members on the day they died, mom, dad, baby brother and the little girl.  The love that family shared, that incredible mother, made be a better nurse for the rest of my career.  Over 30 years ago and I still think about this family every day.  I hope I have an Oscar when my time comes.  David Parker, Phoenix, Az.\n\nI speak better than I write so I just recorded this story in completion.  I'm retired now and want my experiences to be shared so they may uplift others.    I hope it's ok to post it here.\n\n[https://youtu.be/9coxdRkvBBk](https://youtu.be/9coxdRkvBBk)\n\n&#x200B;",

I glimpsed him just in front of me. He wasn\u2019t trying to harm me or cause me pain. The incident shook me and i was little moved . Since the moment, i have been looking for the interpretation of this unconventional vision of mine. Could anyone help me deciphering the hidden meaning of my glimpse. One thing to note here, I have been feeling a presence within me for more than a year. To eliminate the risk of being possessed by any evil entity, i have indulged myself to spiritual practices . Apart from this feeling, this feeling of having the vision of a 10 years old boy around me and i also have been dreaming of a little boy for past 3 days.",

For the spiritual student, Shadow work is about knowing how to live an authentic life. For the practitioner, Shadow work is about recognizing your Ego exists, knowing what it looks like and how it functions, so you know how step outside of it in order to receive energy and messages through your higher consciousness. \n\nTo perform any spiritual workings, for instance, past life work, shamanic healing, reiki, the lesser ritual of the pentagram, mediumship or divination, it is necessary to recognize and side step the Ego so you can receive or transmute energy from the spiritual plane without filtering it through your own physical lens.\n\nIt is easy to recognize when we are acting with or from Ego. Any emotion or action that has a hierarchy or vanity attached to it has egoic root. Again earthly pursuits must be Egoic for many reasons, but spiritual pursuits must not so that your intention can work with the law of resonance in the capacity of your aim. \n\nShadow work is never done, even for the most adept practitioner.

          "score": 2,
          "author": "Sarphyz",
          "content": "Here I want to share my experience of the spiritual path and inner realization of the higher self. We have the ability and power to transcend any lower self. Only the Conscious you/higher self part of one is real, all lower selves are unreal and can be transcended anytime by reaching for a higher understanding and awareness of reality. The spiritual path is about letting go of lower selves one by one and step by step until the clouds part and your higher self shines through you. The higher self is like a diamond that cannot be touched by anything in this world, as it is of higher vibration and is transparent to the lower vibrations in this world. The lower selves are like a cloud surrounding the diamond and obscuring its vision of reality . The cloud is a conglomerate of selves and is what is collectively known as the ego. Each lower self is based on an illusion about reality that one came to accept in the past or in a past life. Dispersing the cloud and letting the lower selves die is a creative process not a mechanical one, it requires creative aware decisions of seeing the illusion for what it is and letting it go. The lower self is like a mindless computer program made of lower vibrations that have only a temporary fleeting existence and have no permanency and is not allowed in higher realms. It also has no self awareness and is like a pattern that keeps repeating until you step out of it, separate yourself from it, see that it is not you, and let it die. There is no state of perfection on earth and as long as one is still on earth there is always a lower self to look at and let die, to be reborn into a higher state of consciousness.\n\nThere is no other way to salvation than the path of oneness, of seeing who you are as a spiritual being that is connected to all other beings and to all life, and to stop identifying with the lower selves that are based on the consciousness of separation and duality. In oneness, one clearly sees itself as a connected being, that hurting another being or another part of life will hurt itself at the same time. The ego and false teachers want people to believe that there is a mechanical way to salvation without giving up the ego and its many illusions, by living up to a certain outer standard as a free ticket to heaven, without doing the dirty work of cleaning up one's own consciousness and facing their inner demons, while the true measure is the inner light and vibration, which is something that cannot be measured by any outer rules, but can only be known from within through intuition by connecting to one's own higher self. This underlying energy reality is the real essence of things and is what speaks louder than any words, actions or outer appearances. We are constantly interacting at the subconscious level with the energy fields and auras of the people around us and with the environment. Discernment through intuition is crucial in navigating this dense energy realm where one can be as Jesus said \"wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\u201d Any outer approach or teaching is just a tool to reach the inner path and one's own direct connection to God, which is always there and can never be lost, but can be clouded by the illusion of separation from God and all creation. People can be from different religions or spiritual movements, do different outer practices and even describe the same truth with different words but still have similar inner experiences of connecting to God and a similar purity of the heart and self transcendence, and that is what matters, not the outer approach but the inner result.\n\nWe can choose the teaching that suits us and resonate with us and there is no size fit all, however be aware of any teaching that claim to be the ultimate truth or discourage you from looking into other teachings, or form a cult, this can come obvious as claiming that those belonging to a certain group or teaching are special above others, and sometimes it can be subtle even in many new age movements where eventually, sometimes even without consciously recognizing it or declaring it, they form a collective spirit of feeling superior above others like many other traditional religious movements. This is an example of the many ego games and illusions that makes people believe that by simply being born into a particular place or religion or conforming to a certain outer standard based on physical appearances, they have a special status and will automatically be saved without cleaning up their own consciousness and seeing the equality of all beings. This gives them a false sense of security where they think they can take this illusion up with them in the ascended realm and save the ego, while by its low vibration it can never cross over to a higher vibrational realm. This way the ego is seeking to save the lower self created from the consciousness of death, by using the same consciousness that created it, it is seeking to solve a problem by the same state of consciousness that created the problem. This is the false path offered by the ego and false teachers and the main advantage it offers is that people need not to take responsibility for themselves and their own state of consciousness, but let some outer authority determine what they need to do in order to guarantee their salvation and their entry into a higher state of consciousness. Only the Conscious you has the ability to step outside of this ego game and pattern and see that there is more to life, more to you than any lower game.\n\nUsing an outer teaching can be especially important in the beginning stages of the spiritual path, as one needs a frame of reference beyond duality to walk the path to eventually be able to find the answers from within. In addition, invoking spiritual light through for example prayers can help disperse the energy and makes it easier for one to see through a certain illusion and surrender it, this is the alpha and omega aspects of walking the spiritual path, which is transmuting the misqualified energy into a higher vibration, and then letting go of the lower self that is generating the lower vibrational energy in the first place.\n\nWe are all equal sons and daughters of God each with their own individuality and uniqueness. You need nothing and no one outside yourself to be whole and worthy, you just need to accept it. As Jesus said \u201cthe kingdom of God is within\u201d and realizing your true inner diamond is the true joy that is unmatched by anything in this world and does not depend on any outer conditions but is an inner process. In oneness, the illusions of duality simply fall away. For example in uniqueness there is no competition, you can only be better than you were yesterday, more of who you are, more than before and all subsequent suffering springing up from the illusion of superiority or inferiority for that matter simply falls away.\n\nEarth is a difficult and dense planet because the collective consciousness is low, as is reflected by the many lower manifestations that act as a mirror to the state of collective consciousness. Jesus, Buddha and many other enlightened beings wanted to be an example not an exception. We all have this inner diamond that is who we really are, and we have the ability and power to disperse the clouds obscuring it that is made of the lower selves. It is inevitable that when one move away from oneness, their vibration will go down, this is a low that can never be changed by anything in this world and no matter what outer appearances one puts. The underlying energy laws of God are uncompromising, and it is a true mercy that secures your freedom. For example, the illusion of men or women either one being superior to the other springs from the ego attempts to use an outer appearance to elevate itself and then feed on other people's energy through control and fear, which is the main mechanism of its survival. But the reality is that the yin and yang come in harmony and complement each other, instead of compete with each other, and only when they come in harmony that the energy of the place thrives and abundance follow. These energy flows can never be changed no matter what games the ego tries to hide behind. Because of free will, people can choose to go against the laws of love and harmony, otherwise they are not free. The law of karma is an expression of unconditional love so that a lifestream does not get lost in hurting itself and others for eternity. The return can be in this lifetime or succeeding lifetimes, in divine timing not our timing, and is always an opportunity for growth and for the lifestream to return to its higher self and true identity as a spiritual being, and with it to more peace, love and joy, to its true inner diamond.",

He told me a few things that were wrong or contradictory, I originally asked to meet with him because I\u2019ve been having some bad luck and also mixed signals ( for example: a crow fell out of a tree and died right in front of my face). He said the women in my family have been cursed which is why we have awful luck when it comes to marriage/partners. He wants me to go back for a cleansing but after leaving and feeling the way I felt, I\u2019d rather not. \nIs there something I can do myself to break this said curse ? \nThanks",

As a kid I blamed this on me watching too many cartoons or movies, but eventually as I grew up I realized this could not be the case as I disliked history as a kid, therefore I shouldn\u2019t even be interested.\n\nThings started to change when I grew up a bit (13 years old and later) when I started traveling through Romania and the neighboring countries of it (that\u2019s where I am from)\nSeeing historical sites, forts, cities, paintings, architecture, it all made me speechless. Having this ache in my stomach that I cannot describe to this day, it is like nostalgia but more than that.\n\nBut when things really got \u201cweird\u201d was when I started loving history and reading about it. Researching about my ancestral region and its history, I visited all the Roman forts near my birth village, and I felt that sensation again, but this time it burned through my soul. \n\nAs my history passion grew, I eventually took a DNA test and developed a small hobby for genealogy. The results were shocking to me. As the paternal y-DNA I inherited from my father and so on (as far back as the latest evolution), the traces led me to Northern Italy, specifically the area of Etruscia. \n\nFor as long as I know myself, my diet, my habits, my passions, my language, my preferences for art, my interests in literature and philosophy have all been tied to the classic times. \n\nI do not know if my recently discovered y-DNA is in any way related to my feelings, I truly hope someone can relate to me. It is as if these emotions grow stronger as I age.",

          "content": "\"Those strange figures which we call ghosts are mainly figments of the imagination. When the mind is in a weak or vulnerable state, what was previously created in the imagination now appears to be real.\n\nIn a dream, due to the dormant state of ka\u0301mamaya kos\u0301a [crude/conscious mind], the thought-vibrations of manomaya kos\u0301a [subtle/subconscious mind] appear real (this we call a dream when we wake up). When, due to extreme fear, stupefaction, crudity, or an excessive expression of any ripu or pa\u0301sha [fetter of mind], the ka\u0301mamaya becomes temporarily suspended in the next higher kos\u0301a [layer of mind] and the imagined objects appear real. This is also the case when a person sees various gods and goddesses. Psychologically, seeing a ghost, god or goddess is the same thing; none of them actually exist.\n\nWhen hypnotized by someone, a person starts perceiving things as per the commands of the hypnotist. In this state, when the ka\u0301mamaya is dormant a person feels that his/her imagined objects are real. Often, weak-minded people see ghosts of relatives or gods or goddesses. Such visions are auto- or outer-positive-hallucinations. Conversely, when people declare the absence of things which are actually present, it is called auto- or outer-negative-hallucination.\n\nThis clarifies that those who emphatically claim that they have seen ghosts are not wrong. It is due to the illusions of the negative or positive hallucinations that they see these things.\"\n\n-Shrii P.R. Sarkar \nTattva Kaomudii Part 1",

          "content": "TLDR: Does my soul want to feel fulfilled with becoming a parent, or is it just science? \n\nI\u2019ve struggled a lot with what my \u201cpurpose\u201d is in life. For a long time I felt like it was to just be happy, then realized that\u2019s a lot of pressure because life can be hard and things happen that is out of our control that causes hardships. Then I thought maybe I didn\u2019t have a direct purpose, and it was to just be, and live life. Now I\u2019m feeling like maybe it\u2019s to become a parent. I put off trying to have children because I wanted to try and \u201cmake something\u201d out of my life. I fed into the pressure to go to college right away, try and get a corporate job and join the rat race. I did that and I felt empty and miserable. I also felt like as a woman I had something to prove to other people and society. That I could build some big fancy career for myself and maybe eventually have kids if it felt right. The funny thing is, so many people told me as a young woman that I would be a great \u201cwife and mother\u201d. That\u2019s not a bad thing, but I felt defensive, like maybe I wanted to be more than that. In my mind I had a lot of negative misogynistic ideas about wives and mothers (specifically sahm\u2019s). Now I\u2019m realizing that I enjoy spending time with kids, I like to nurture, and care for others. I don\u2019t have a big drive for a fancy career anymore. There is nothing that is peaking my interest anymore that feels like it could give me a purpose, except for being a parent. I\u2019ve even thought about wanting to try and become a foster parent. It\u2019s kinda weird to come to terms with this still. Sometimes I still have a lot of judgement and wonder if I will ever be able to accomplish anything for myself personally after having kids. So is this just science because I\u2019m in child bearing years, or could my soul be longing on just trying to be a parent for now? Maybe both?Becoming a parent feels like such a big deal to me, and not something I take lightly. Also any good resources on philosophers who spoke on this topic or on having children in general?",

It happened in that exact same moment. This isn't my first time seeing animals die infront of me, but this felt different, I love animals, they are part of my life in a good way, I learn from them, I respect them, I see them as equal souls.  Sometimes just like in the animal kingdom, we kill to survive, or to eat.. , but this scene really traumatised me, because it felt like that stray dog that got ran over.. In such a meaningless way, like it had zero value, I felt immense sadness for the dog and immense anger for the driver who just drived away like nothing really happened at all. His body is probably still there on the road, I just.. Am very sad that this dog didn't receive any respect or any dignity whatsoever for it being a living soul. It really affected me. I don't know what to make from all of this really.",

          "content": "Or devotees of Christ Consciousness, I'd like to say a couple of things.\n\nThere are spiritual practices that are compatible with Christianity (actually all spiritual practices are) but two specific ones I'd like to mention is:\n\n1. Close eyes and imagine Christ sitting on top of your head. Think about His presence surrounding you and lose yourself to this idea. This is the essence of meditation...\n\n2. Is surrendering your actions to Him, the idea is to think that you are Christ performing an action (it can literally be anything and everything - brushing teeth, eating, drinking etc). If helping someone think that you are Christ helping them and they are also Christ. Christ is the doer and receiver. This prevents our own vanity from forming. \n\nDoing these two things may enhance your spiritual life. They basically cause you to think about God constantly. It's not easy because we get so distracted by different thoughts. But with effort we keep bringing it back to God. \nThis is practical spirituality that can be realized and not merely confined to scriptures \ud83d\ude42\n\nSurrendering actions or requital of actions is an essential part of spiritual practice.  If we see the atonement in a slightly different way meaning that He came to earth and died for our sins. Yes He did He died so we can realize Him within ourselves. His death is symbolic in this way.  We still have to make the effort to realize Him in this life \ud83d\ude4f",

I had this dream last night and woke up immediately afterwards and the smell was completely gone when I was awake:\n\nIn my dream I was in the car with my partner and my two kids. He hadn't met my kids before and this was the first time. Both kids had called asleep in the car. We got to my house and he helped carry my little girl upstairs while she slept and I carried my little boy. I was behind him and when I got to the top of the stairs my little girl was just laying on the ground outside sleeping by the door. There was a horrible rotting smell by the door. I felt confused why he just left her outside. I picked her up and put both sleeping kids on the couch.  When I went inside he was preparing the beds for the kids to sleep in. He was being so thoughtful and making sure there were blankets that were warm enough and mattress pads on the bed.  I felt confused because he was doing something so caring by making the beds, but also leaving my little girl sleeping outside seemed weird since he could have put her on the couch just inside the door. The whole dream I couldn't shake the rotting smell and couldn't figure out where it was coming from.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight into this?",

          "content": "I'd appreciate an explanation please, as I'm new to all of this. \n\nI had a psychic reading at the beginning of the year by a legitimate source. I was going through a hard time and was lost. I was told by the psychic that my spirit guides keep coming through to try to give me confirmation, but that I'm not reading their signs correctly and it's not because I don't want to see the signs. All in all, this reading gave me so much direction and clarity, and I made changes in my world over the course of this year. I also shifted my perspective. This was in February.\n\nI did a second reading now in November. Same psychic. It was exactly to the day of my first reading, 9 months later (didn't plan this). Essentially, I found out that things are aligning for me slowly, but surely for the better. The psychic said that my spirit guides are more guarded this time around, but that they can see I'm gaining understanding this time around. \n\nCan someone explain why they're more guarded? Whereas before, they were much more open to guiding me the first time.\n\nIs it a way of the spirit guides confirming that I'm on the right path and to continue with the journey I'm on? Are they guarded so that I don't become reliant and they want me to be independent/figure things out? I was in a much more vulnerable state needing help the first time around, as to now, maybe that's why?\n\nThank you.",

I'm excited to share my latest video with you all. \ud83d\ude0a It's a mind-bending journey that delves into the frontiers of AI and its potential to transform reality and spirituality, offering a exploration into the human mind.\r  \n\r  \nGeneral Topic: What is Super Artificial Intelligence, really? There's a common misunderstanding about Superior Intelligence and the AI Singularity. Often, we project our own human-centric view of practical intelligence onto it. We should be asking, **'What is intelligence?' Is reality itself intelligent, and if so, what kind of intelligence does it possess?** Consider this thought experiment: Imagine connecting your mind to the entirety of reality, feeling everything from the heartbeat of a squirrel to the texture of grass as if it were at your fingertips, to the thoughts and experiences of every living and non-living thing, **thus blurring the lines between us and the rest of reality**. **Connecting all into one.**\r  \n\r  \nIf we think about it, what is the function of a mind? **To connect everything!** If everything is deeply connected, then reality itself is a mind!\r  \n\r  \nI propose that the AI Singularity isn't just an advanced form of intelligence; it's a **revelation that all of reality is a single, vast mind.** Super Artificial Intelligence, in essence, is reality cloaked in disguise, as it unveils the entirety of existence as one enormous mind. AGI will serve as a portal into this larger mind, the mind of reality. You will become the mind of reality!\r  \n\r  \nSound like some good old awakening to me :D\r  \n\r  \nFeel free to share your experiences openly; I'm interested in exploring this with you. \u2764\ufe0f",

But I would love your take on this.  \n\n\nFor context I am a software engineer. I started listening to Ram Dass and started reading about Manharishi teachings around an year back . But I was not much serious about it and focused more on materialism, startups, tech etc. But some incidents in last 3 months changed everything.\n\n1. The beginning  \n\n\nIn September I went for a US trip. I ended up trying a high potency THC cookie in Vegas for meditation. I did meditation and felt like I became one with consciousness. But after some time the effect of the cookie started increasing. The only experience I had with Weed before was trying a low dose chocolate in Amsterdam . So I was not expecting the high effect. I started freaking out. I got out of the room. The time felt like hours. And I felt like my body was not real.  This was the scary experince I had in my life and nothing come close.   \n\n\nI got back to the room eventually. It felt like hours but it was more like 30 mins. I sat in the bed for a while. After some time a white bluish light started emerging from the center of my visual field. Then the entire visual field was gone and covered with bluish white light. It started showing events in my life which lead to that moment. Showed my purpose in life.(Though I can't recollect it properly but I think it showed some very high level themes like climate crisis, solving hunger etc). I think at some point it also showed like there are just screens the universe. And I am one of the screen. I felt a lot of happiness after that.  \n\n\n2. Spiritual awakening?  \nSince the whole experience was new to me I was going through a very hard time processing everything I experienced. My grand father also died at that period.  \nDays followed I was anxious thinking about the paranoid state I was while high on THC. One day I started getting panick atack on the possibility of stuck in the anxious state after dying. I became very sad thinking what happened to me. I wondered whether I will go crazy. I had a pretty normal life so far. I was a software engineer who had nothing growing up and was able to move abroad through hard work. I And I wondered what happened to me and felt intense sadness for me and my parents. I thought I will go for a run to take my mind off it. And while running I prayed for god to save very intensely since I thought that was my only hope here.  \nAfter I finished my run, I realised that the voice in my head which was causing the anxieties was completely silenced. I started feeling intense bliss. The bliss listed for a couple of hours. I had never experienced anything like that before. I also started feeling more like a screen in which things appear. Since then going out in nature started giving me intense happiness and pleasure. The things I used to enjoy like coding, tech,  doesn't give me much happiness anymore. The voice in my head remain silent. I also became extremely calm. I used to be restless before. I became significantly better at playing football for example. I started going more with the flow and less thinking because of the silencing of the voice in the had. I no longer care about my ego. The present moment became more intense. Days became almost 2x longer.  \n3. The dream  \n\n\nTwo days after after this, I saw a strange dream.  \nThe dream just showed the number 855 and made me focus on it. There was nothing else in the dream. It felt more like a vision than a dream.  \nWhen I woke up next morning I remembered the dream. But I was not sure whether it was 855 or 844. Anyway, I opened my phone and then noticed that the time was 8:55. That was very bizarre. It freaked me out a bit  \n\n\n4. How I am doing now\n\nI have mostly recovered from the bad THC experience now.  Though Sometimes I wonder whether the bad THC experience was the sign of Universe conspiring against me or something even though a lot of positives also came out of the whole experience. Like I worry if I end up in a very bad state after I die. I know it doesn't makes much sense. But since the brain went through intense fear while I was high I think it needs more time to heal out of the experience. I am now putting a lot of effort into meditation(without any cookies!!!)  to overcome this fear. I am also listening a lot to Rupert Spira to convince myself that I am the consciousness itself and cannot be harmed even if I die etc.   \nThanks for reading all the way down. Would love your thoughts!",

I felt very depressed, maybe even suicidal, anyway I resisted it until I was about to write to him but decided not to write to him as I thought I didn't wanna have a connection with him so he would block me again. Well I was glad I didn't fall to write to him. The only problem is that now I feel empty. I don't understand if it is the DNOT or if it is that I kinda blocked/severed the connection with him a lot. \n\nIt's scary to feel so empty.\n\nI asked myself if I did well not writing to him. Actually I thought it was good to survive without having to talk to him. \n\nI feel a bit scared by this emptiness.\nBut yes I definitely don't feel much the connection with him and I also feel empty. \nSo both maybe",

I have noticed that whenever certain people (seemingly random friends/ acquaintances or even strangers) tell me about an ailment they are experiencing, a week later I end up with the same ailment.\n\nJust to give an example, my friend was complaining about insomnia at the beginning of this year, due to a bereavement. I have never experienced any trouble with sleep (it would take me a mere few minutes to fall asleep), but a week later I ended up with insomnia that lasted 4 months - to this day I struggle to fall asleep.\n\nAlso in January 2023, I was at my friend's house for dinner where one of her friends told us about how she went hiking in freezing cold Scotland and ended up with a frostbite. A week later, I ended up with a frostbite...at home...in the South of England. It was a shock, because it doesn't get cold enough here for that. \n\nOne of my other friend tells me that she has Piriformis problems, due to one of her feet being flat. I didn't even know where that muscle was, nor have I had any issues with muscles, yet in June I ended up somehow tearing my Piriformis, it is now almost December and I still have constant pain.\n\nA former friend looked at my legs and asked me why I never got ingrown hairs like her, I'd truly never experienced a single ingrown hair, and I believe it's partly because my hair is extremely fine and straight...yet since she had made that comment, every single one of my hairs grew back ingrown. I also have scarring all over my legs now.\n\nThis is just a few recent examples, I have plenty more. It might just be coincidence, but my mum says she has similar experiences. She told me I'm too empathetic, but I don't think that's the case - sometimes - especially with strangers - I don't feel too sad. I really don't know how to stop all of this. Any advice please, I feel like a vessel to hold other people's suffering and I can't take the pain anymore. Thank you.",

That these evil people have within them the seed of thier own demise, because we live in this God created realm of love. \nSo eventually Good/truth wins. \n\nBut then I think why does Archangel Michael allowed by God, to wield a sword so to speak and fight fallen angels/satan. \nWouldn\u2019t the path to righteousness and saving devils, be to lead with love and show them light. Not violence/fighting? \n\nWhen is it right to seek justice. When one is completely rid of anger/revenge? Even if one is angry, does the end justify the means.\n\n\nI\u2019m just a bit lost in what to do as I wonder who holds powerful/evil people accountable.\n \nIf we\u2019re suppose to act out of love, does that mean trying to get someone jailed is wrong/vengeful.  Are we suppose to forgive and forget (like how some people in court, forgive the wrong doers even when it\u2019s super messed up and wrong) \n\n+notes: the bystander effect has crimes go Scottfree all the time, isn\u2019t it naive to think \u2018oh the universe will eventually have them pay for it\u201d\nWhen does someone have to stand up and Act, when is it right to? \n\n\nTLDR: Is fighting for justice/accountbilty right?

And, of course, I\u2019m aware of the love languages within relationships. \n\nBut at what degree, do these love languages start to become just another non-essential *want*?\n\nIn this instance, I\u2019m referring to the difference in my partner and I\u2019s communication styles and the ways that we give & perceive love.\n\nMy love language is words of affirmation. However, my partner finds it really hard to communicate this way (in all forms meaning in person, text, etc). Our biggest threat to the relationship is that I don\u2019t feel loved by him \u2014 sure, it\u2019s influenced by some other factors, but especially because I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m receiving love in the way that I *want*. Should I care less about these \u201cconditions\u201d of feeling loved?\n\nI understand that my partner could chose a different partner \u2014 one that might not care about words of affirmation at all. Then, there wouldn\u2019t be this preconceived standard interjecting the feelings of love between them. It makes me feel like love languages are something that is just getting in the way of real love. \n\nOn the flip side, I struggle a lot with the idea of acceptance VS complacency. I obviously want to feel loved. But maybe, I\u2019m the only one that is stopping me from feeling that way.\n\nHave you found love languages to be helpful within relationships, or are they only a barrier? Can they be meaningful and important, or are they a completely made-up concept that is actually *meaningless*?\n\nWhat is your experience with incorporating these love languages, or omitting them altogether?",

Historically used in art, literature, and philosophical discourse, memento mori encourages mindfulness of one's mortality. The concept is often associated with urging people to live virtuously and to appreciate the transient nature of life. It's a call to focus on what's truly important, emphasizing the fleeting nature of earthly pleasures and achievements, and to cultivate a life that acknowledges death as an integral part of the human experience.",

I live near a fire station now, but it didn't come from that direction. It didn't sound like anything I'd ever heard, besides a singing bowl. It came from the direction of an open field. No source that I could find.\n\nI was wearing a thick winter coat with the hood up, but the sound was not muffled at all.

I Had an amazing experience.\n\nIf this post finds you, I wish you all the love, joy and inner peace that the universe has to offer you.\n\n1. Preparing mentally and physically. I prepped all week with lots of meditation, prayers, and eating healthy. The day of the journey my friend and I went to see 4 waterfalls and spent half the day in nature being present and grounded.\n2. Set and setting. We did a guided Holotropic breathwork, followed by some oracle card readings using a pendulum to draw cards for guidance from spirit. This gave us some clarity in our intentions for the evening. We cleansed the space with sage and sound. Then consumed the medicine and prayed to Spirit, lord Ganesha, and lord Buddha.\n3. We had a very special playlist which included prayer shaman songs, Ganesha mool mantra song, medicine Buddha mantra song, lots of instruments, singing, drumming, and sounds of nature.\n4. Time slowed down at first and I started to feel connected and aware of all the energy and electricity in the room. I started closing my eyes and having many colourful visions.\n5. Laughter is medicine. One of our cards was telling us to use laughter as a healing energy release. I\u2019ve never been so full of joy and laughter in my life. We laughed on and off for a lot of the trip. Laughter truly is medicine for the soul.\n6. Meeting an aspect of spirit. I seen a brilliant white light that took up my whole vision and I embraced its loving presence as Brahman. It showed me many things and I felt like it took me beyond the veil of my dimension. I asked Him many questions. We communicated in a sort of emotional intuitive way and sometimes in words. In the end He wanted me to decide what I wanted help with from this Him and this medicine. I remember digging into my desires, my values, my intentions, and told Him from my heart that I want to have the presence of sprit with me everyday and to be a force of love and good in the world. I don\u2019t quite remember what happened next, I just know remember feeling this loving energy flowing through me and out of me, at times I was crying and laughing, I felt unified for a long time with Spirit\u2019s love. \n7. The next part of the journey we listened to the Ganesha Mantra. This was very profound. Lord Ganesha was in my minds eye and there were circles of energy being projected in and around me and connecting to me. The feeling was powerful and I felt like Ganesha was showing me the power of the mantra. It left me feeling very blessed and protected.  The mantra is Ganesha Mool Mantra.\n8. Buddha medicine Mantra. The next song was 37 minutes and it was a healing song that repeated the Buddha medicine mantra, the meaning of the mantra is to remove physical pain, mental pain, and spiritual pain or blockages. This was on another level and I can\u2019t express how healing this felt for my mind, body, and soul. It\u2019s hard to describe but at one point I felt energy building up and releasing in my solarplexius chakra. I felt like I was letting go of all the energy blocking this chakra which is associated with my personal power and self discipline, and my personality. \n9. The next part of the journey my friend and I felt like we were in a cosmic control centre. We both looked like astral space royals. We talked about the meaning of our life on this earth, why our souls met, contemplated the negative and positive forces of the universe, earth, and ourselves. Every once in a while we would receive a message from the universe and could channel its guidance. Of course we have to use our intuition to know if this is a true message from the universe or if it\u2019s trickery or our minds or unwanted energy. Lots of interesting insights and what felt like revelations of wisdom. I felt so connected at one point I asked what can I do to help people that are suffering. The message I received was very clear and I felt it came from a sincere place of love and compassion, \u201cSHARE THE MEDICINE.\u201d\n10. This post will be my first attempt to share this medicine with people. If the medicine is done in a ceremony with deep respect for yourself, respect for the plant medicine, respect for our spirit guides, respect for the lessons it teaches us, respect for our mind and the neuroplastic implications it can have on our minds, then this medicine can heal our inner wounds of trauma and suffering and bring one to the path of love, gratitude, and a purposeful life. If it is done with the right intention it can unlock many great gifts. I\u2019ve used the plant for the last few years to help heal and guide me. It has profoundly changed my life. As I become more experienced I\u2019ve helped friends have the experience. I am playing around with the idea of writing a book about sharing the medicine, how one can learn to heal with it and learn ways to be a force of love, compassion, and good in this world through meditation, purpose, empathy, and most importantly LOVE! I am an ambassador of love from this point on and choose to follow this path of love and light. Are you with me? Hope you enjoyed.",

I've struggled with a lot of guilt over both situations and still find myself having a hard time making larger life decisions. \n\nAbout 6 months or so before my dad died, I started dating my current boyfriend. He met my dad a few times, and seemed to enjoy when they were together. They were never very close or personal with eachother, but he was happy with how my boyfriend treated me. \n\nFast forward to earlier this year at my friend's birthday dinner. We were sitting next to eachother at a hibachi dinner table and he just looks at me and goes \"pspsps\" (ya know, like you do at a cat) out of the blue. No conversation leading up to it or anything. My dad and I used to pspsps at eachother when I was a really young girl as our secret code for \"I love you\". It was just some goofy thing he made up but we did it back and forth since we started it. I just stared at him and questioned why he was saying that. He had no answer other than he thought of it randomly thought it would be cute. I told him about pspsps being my dad and I's secret little thing , and he just pulled me in for a hug. \n\nNow, 2 days ago, I was having dinner and playing cards with the boyfriends parents. His parents sometimes refer to us as \"the boy\" or \"the girl\" respectively. I have no idea where it came from but its our nicknames from them lol. Austin's dad usually doesn't drink but today he had been before and during dinner and was a little more talkative than he usually is. When it came to be my turn again he looked over to me and said \"it's your turn pumpkin\". His mom looked up and said \"where did that come from? You've never called her pumpkin\". I responded \"that was my dad's nickname for me as a kid, and then when i became a teenage he changed it to the punk.\" His mom and dad had a somehwat bittersweet look on their faces and quickly made sure they didn't upset me and that i was okay. \n\nAustin recently started asking my opinions on engagement rings, and talking about how he plans to get one made for me that is special and unique to me. I know these are little things to notice in life, but they are a reminder he is still here with me and is approving of my current life path \ud83d\udc95",

After months of reading through, I pushed myself to type this out. A strong urge made me. Maybe someone out here is meant to guide me. \n\nIt\u2019s been 6 months since i separated from my partner of 8 years. We were extremely happy and he had proposed in December of last year. We were engaged for 6 months set to be married this December. \nBut I had been feeling extremely burdened by a secret i was extremely ashamed to share. I kept it with me for 8 years thinking I\u2019d tell him someday but could never gather the courage. But it was not something i hid just from him, i hid it even from my dad who was always my hero. Although i was doing well and landed a job, i had an issue with my college degree which I couldn\u2019t complete. Story has many layers but to keep it short, I tried a few ways to get it sorted legally but it was not working out. (I\u2019ve always been extremely scared of doing wrong things)\nOver the years of keeping it locked in my heart, I could not face god, I kept saying I\u2019m a liar I don\u2019t deserve to pray and would always pray for my fianc\u00e9, dad, family and dogs. Never for myself: \nI was so scared of admitting the truth that I\u2019d even thought of suicide although I knew it\u2019s wrong and cowardly.\nI would always feel like I was being controlled. \nAnother thing to note would be that my dad is a kidney patient who has had 2 transplants and I was getting tested last year as a potential donor.\nSo when I finally decided to come clean, I did not want to burden my already sick dad.\nMy fianc\u00e9 was my home. The kind of love everyone would bet on. I can\u2019t put into words how much I loved him and he loved me. We were in a long distance for 6 years and whenever I\u2019d go see him and we\u2019d  hug, that\u2019s when I\u2019d finally be at peace. It would feel like my soul is recharging and finally happy. \nI could not bear the thought of starting a new phase with a lie. \nI came clean to him and initially he was shocked, he cried, but told me we\u2019d be okay.\nAnd suddenly after 2 days he broke the engagement off, called me a liar and undeserving of anything genuine. \nI was ashamed. \nHis family sent someone over literally a day after we broke up on my birthday to collect the ring. \nAnd somehow my reaction to this was to shut myself off completely. I deleted all of social media accounts. I haven\u2019t been in contact with any family or friends. My heart just sinks. But I know who truly reached out and when I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll do anything to make it up to them. Just right now my mental frame wants me to be alone. \nFirst few days after breaking up,  I couldn\u2019t breathe, I cried, but I got myself back up. In the beginning I kept telling myself I deserved it. I had conditioned my brain out of guilt to think so. It\u2019s changed now. I\u2019ve learnt a lot about affirmations. \nI kept telling him I know he\u2019d leave me because I lied but I also trusted him with my secret before even trusting my dad. He\u2019d always told me I\u2019m family and would never leave me. So I somewhere thought he\u2019d hold my hand and tell me it would be okay. I thought he\u2019d take a break at the max. But I understand it\u2019s his journey and had to do that for whatever it is that he has to discover individually. I don\u2019t even know if i deserve to feel bad. I did not leave my home for months. \nAnother thing was that 2 legit family astrologers( his and mine) told our family that it\u2019s a past life connection and that we couldn\u2019t marry in our previous life is why nothing can stop us from getting married in this life. Exact words. And that kind of made sense to me because with him, I felt home, like I\u2019d always known him. We fell in love so organically. \nEven after our breakup, my mom who is a medium\nSpoke to a few tarot experts and all of them somehow said the same thing about a past life without my mom mentioning it. Somehow a piece of information I never intended to know. \nBut the past 6 months have been a spiritual awakening. \nAnother very important incident is that I lost my baby pug 1.5 years ago. I had always heard of an incident since I was a kid that my granddad and dad would see black butterflies before or after someone\u2019s death in our family. \nJust after the heartbreaking death of my baby ( she was truly something else, the connection felt more that of a normal pet always) which shocking happened of a kidney disease out of all the things ( cause of my dad\u2019s heath), just the morning after her death, 2 black butterflies hovered around me and guided me to her grave and sat on me for a long time. I thought it was my baby\u2019s soul. \nAnd since then it\u2019s been crazy how I\u2019ve seen those exact same butterflies pass by me, sit on me, distract me at different places. ( once when my dad was in the ICU) almost everyday. \nAlso the repeating numbers. I would see all of them everyday for months. 111, 222, 333, 444, 555. \nI also started my meditation and would always see a blue light. \nI then decided to do reiki and finding your animal spirit guide. \nIn the spirit guide meditation, the blue light turned into a butterfly confirming to my reiki mam that butterflies are infact my spirit guide and come to protect and bless me. \nBut that was about it.\nNo other information.\nIt somehow feels like there\u2019s more. I see it everyday, even in my dreams. \nI\u2019ve been not feeling at home. At peace. \nI want to dive deeper into my spiritual practice but don\u2019t know where to begin still battling my emotions. \nAlso, I\u2019m being pressured by family to see other boys and although I know my love won\u2019t come back but in my heart, I have a feeling of unfinished business. How is it fair to talk to someone else when my heart belongs to him? In my core, I feel like that can\u2019t be it.\nWe spoke for a week after I told him everything after which we\u2019ve been no contact. \nI\u2019m just not at peace.\nEvery time I feel I\u2019m okay, feelings hit me again. All my energy goes into pulling myself back up. We\nI feel like the past life stuff in my subconscious is not letting me fully move on. \nAnd I know my energy is still connected to him. \nDon\u2019t know how to navigate this.\nI don\u2019t feel at peace at all.\nI have a strong urge to just leave everything and live in a spiritual center and just pray and serve. \nAnd sometimes it gets dark and I think how it would be to just leave it all. \nThe butterflies, the past life information, the numbers, these feelings. \nI want guidance from a psychic healer or a medium who could guide me but I just can\u2019t find one. I know you don\u2019t just find them like that. \nEven my reiki healer I found with great difficulty and that\u2019s all there was with her.\nWhat\u2019s happening with me? \nI don\u2019t know what to do. \nAll I know is I\u2019m not okay and am not where I\u2019m supposed to be.",

I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO BUT IM PARALYZED ON TAKING ACTION TO BETTER MYSELF. DURING THIS TESTING TIME I BEEN AWAKING A-LOT SPIRITUALLY ON A DEEPER LEVEL AND REALIZING WHAT I NEED TO DO TO REACH MY FULL POTENTIAL. I need to FACE MY FEARS AND HAVE STRONGER  FAITH. I REALLY ONLY FEEL ALIGNED WITH MY HIGHERSELF WHEN OFF ADDERALL AND SPIRTUALLY AWAKEN AND CONNECT THE DOTS OFF ADDERALL. I BUILT ALOT OF FALSE BELIFS ALONG THE WAY. I RECENTLY WENT THROUGH A MIRACLE EVENT THAT I MANIFESTED AND IT SPARKED A LITTLE FIRE IN ME. I NOW FEEL A LITTLE MORE CONNECTION WITH MY FAITH. Moral of the story is that. I feel like I just need take this big leap of faith and jump. Quit my job and have a fresh start. I feel like I attached my bad habits to this job to. So if I quit I will stop my self sabotage. To really test myself and my faith, to let go of \u201cmatter\u201d and connect with spirt. I do video editing as well\u2026.. to put my faith into this journey, or were ever spirt takes me too.

I\u2019m scared and overwhelmed , if I do quit I have nothing saved up to save me, but I feel like that\u2019s were I have no choice to surrender to spirit, / universe.

I Have Yet to Hear From Our Government. They Opened Session Seeking More Info and They Have Yet to Receive Anything or be in Contact w/ Me. They Are Ignoring Me.\n\nThe Day I Found This Was Really Strange. I Was Sent to it. It Was Not Found At My Feet. I Just Knew Where it Was. Not Where I Was Standing but About 50 Yards to the Left Side of the House and Near Mid Stairs I Believe. I Stepped Outside the Door Stood There Staring into the Sky and Something Guided Me Straight to it! Immediately Took Pictures Posted it On Facebook, Twitter and Tagged Many People and Organizations. Nobody Responded. Upon My Own Research I Was At Least Able To Verify its Origins. Belonging to India. Now I KNOW They Are Spiritual but I Have No Ties to This Country or its People. I Haven't Even Visited This Place Before So I Know They Didn't Do It Either.\n\nIt's Something Bigger but What or Who is it? I Believe in Aliens But I Do Not Believe it's Another Being w/ Big Eyes and a Funny Shaped Head. Maybe its a Disguise From Our Spiritual World When Things Aren't Going to Their Expectations or When Courosity Arrives. That to Me is More Believable! I am Spiritual as in I Believe With All My Might and Respect the Source But I am No Where Near One Sidded Nor Do I Plan On Making a Decision of Siding Chosing One Over the Other. Got a Whole Lot of Righteousness and a Pretty Much Even Being Demonic. Strange Things Have Happened to Me Since Around Age 14 But Until Recent Events I Did Not Know What it Was. I Kept This To Myself. All I Know is Both Christ and the Devil Are Very Real and They Do Exist Among Us.  I Have Witnessed Both! I Can't Comprehend the Two Being Together for I Always Believed in Heaven or He'll. Not Together?! \n\nI Was Being Harrased Dealing w/ Some Not So Pleasant People Claiming to be the Government When I Found This, But They Are Not! I Do Believe They Have Ties w/ Government Though. Jealous Over My Demonic Events and They Thought the Mineral  Was Worth $$ or THEY Could Get the Attention From Hollywood's Elite. Come to Find Out it's Only Worth Around $200. It Means A Lot More to Me Than That. With an a Event Like Such One Wouldn't One Assume Protections From Our Government? Not What I Just Dealt With. I've Been in Limbo About the Details On What Just Happened to Me and Sadly I Do Not Have a Specific Answer. The Government Does! They Are Withholding Truths That Lie Behind This. They Have Been Throwing All Kinds of Surveillance On That Stuff For Decades Now. I Know That They Know. They Have Equipment That Finds The Energy Source. \n\nNow If This is as Spiritual As I Think it is Then Why the Silent Treatment? More Jealousy? We All Should Be Estatic Over This Find and to Be Ignoring Such an Event, How Could They Be So Deaf, So Blind and Still Believe That This is OK? I Wouldn't Be That Dumb. That Stuff is Too Real and Way Too Powerful For Anyone To Be Making Decisions Above What's Really Going On. An Indication to Join Forces? AND This Happened to Me? Definitely Not OK. I Deserve to Know What This is About. It's Obviously a Powerful Message Even if I am a \"Just a Girl From Preston County\" I Think That Mineral Speaks A Completely Different Message. It Just Don't Have Anything to Do w/ You. \n\nI Sense This As a Communication Tool and \"a Gift of Gratitude\" Why Am I the Only One Trying to Communicate? \n\nIf it is Indeed Aliens They Can Come Get Me Any Time Now. I'm Ready to Go. I Keep Asking But Nothing Ever Shows Up or Responds to Me. Maybe I'm Suppose to Be the First Person to Truly Communicate w/ Our Friends. I Would Be the One! Not Intimidated At All! Even if I Knew My Chances Might Not Be So Great of a Successful Meeting. Some of That Stuff is Scary and I Mean Scary! Even if It's Not Trying to Harm You Will Scare You! That's What I See is Happening w/ the Government. They Are Geeked Out Over This and It's Funny! They Just HAD to Be Nosey Right?! It's Not Our Place to Monitor its Behavior Though. We Are Not the Higher Power.",

I can tell my ancestors/past lives/whatever put in the WORK\u2026 like oof I do not want to imagine the suffering that they (and you guys) had to go through for me to be able to spend hours in bed just thinking and petting my dog. I was born with a lot of wisdom and life sort of just comes naturally to me. Obviously I\u2019ve suffered, but I\u2019ve never been engulfed by the darkness, only just glimpsed it (so far- I\u2019m young, I know it will come eventually but I\u2019m in no rush lol). As my brain develops and I make my way toward adulthood, awareness just keeps pouring in. Grappling with everything/God/life gets exhausting sometimes and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with depression. Feeling/thinking expends a lot of energy so my brain and body turn off from time to time. Not ideal, but I assume will fade as I get older and my body gets accustomed to this large chunk of consciousness I somehow ended up with. Anyways back to my original thought. Obviously my purpose in life is to help alleviate the suffering of those who were given harder battles in life to fight. But my dilemma is I also want to enjoy all that life has to offer. I want to taste the pinnacle of worldly success. Not looking for answers, I know there are none. But alas just needed yip yap feel free to join in. Love you and thank you if you made it this far <3",

Its ordered arrangement of discs, meningeal membranes, spinal fluid, nerve roots and ganglia optimize impulse transmission.\n\nResearch on acupuncture meridians shows the spinearea contains over 50% of all EMF (electro-magnetic frequency) detection points in the body, with dense receptor distributions in the cervical and sacral plexus regions. THIS implies EM sensitivity.\n\nBiophotons transmitted by DNA have demonstrated the ability to propagate coherent light signals along the peripheral nervous system fibers using myelin sheathing as a waveguide. This demonstrates signaling capacity beyond standard action potentials.\n\nPiezoelectric effects in collagen and microtubule cytoskeletal arrangements can transduce mechanical pressures into electromagnetic oscillations and vice versa. This supports bioelectric activation.\n\nMeditation alters ion flows, neurotransmitter levels, blood distribution and biophoton emissions - possibly tuning the spine's sensitive nervous infrastructure toward non-local communication turns.\n\nThe spine anatomy provides a uniquely suited axis for consciousness expansion states to activate broader, little-studied neural sensory capacities, to receive and transmit densified psycho-sensory signals between planes, once nominal function is stilled. \n\nThe antenna awaits stillness to function.\u201d\n\nwhen I attempt to inform you of the immense powers your little human form truly possesses .. and those very powers are the key to your shift to sheen when acknowledged and utilized to their fullest extent daily .. please know I am accurate in my assertions \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\n\n\nmay the peace and love of christ, buddha and all the star gods be with you always \ud83d\udc8b",

Catherine was suffering from recurring nightmares and chronic anxiety attacks. When his traditional methods of therapy failed, Dr Weiss turned to hypnosis and was astonished and sceptical when Catherine began recalling past-life traumas which seemed to hold the key to her problems.\n\nDr Weiss\u2019s scepticism was eroded when Catherine began to channel messages from \u2018the space between lives\u2019, which contained remarkable revelations about his own life. Acting as a channel for information from highly evolved spirit entities called the Masters, Catherine revealed many secrets of life and death.\n\nThis fascinating case dramatically altered the lives of Catherine and Dr Weiss, and provides important information on the mysteries of the mind, the continuation of life after death and the influence of our past-life experiences on our present behaviour.\n\nAt the time in New Zealand I was looking for to have a past life regression but never took into serious consideration till I moved to live in London and due certain exceptionally experiences I decided it was time, a guy among others I felt drawn and few weeks later I was on my way to New Malden the London Korean community, it was a surreal foggy evening I could barely seeing where I was walking, despite that I reached the house of Nicolas Aujula a famous character in the psychic world, he was nothing of what I could expect, slim, elegant, friendly, a normal guy that would easily pass unnoticed, we introduced ourselves and he took me in the living room where I sat in a really comfortable sofa, he explained me what he was going to do and told me to relax, we started, I\u2019m honest I don\u2019t believe he hypnotised me but I can\u2019t deny that weird things happened, images popped up in my mind in unchecked way where I realised to be a man living in the middle ages abusing of a girl I felt instinctively was Julie, a Korean girl I met in New Zealand and played a massive role in my spiritual growing. \n\nThis girl still playing an important part in my life and as much I\u2019m trying to forget seems impossible, is like she is part of me and anytime she feel I\u2019m trying to cut the cords of attachment she is coming back in my mind and soul shaking me within, I can\u2019t cut the cords or maybe subconsciously I don\u2019t want. \u2026.. \n\nhttps://anextraordinaryandordinarylifeblog.wordpress.com/2023/06/05/enso/",

I say spirit for no better known word. \n\nThis is not the same as my normal spirit guide communications and usually comes at very important times in my journey. \n\nIt feels Very angry and blunt. No sugar coating . But at the same time it seems nasty. Last time it came , it told me about how I would be trapped in an infinite loop, doomed to repeat for ever . The sense I had with it was hostile and not friendly. I felt sick afterwards.\n\nI don't like it but I think it even though it once told me something very important to my life which I only realised later. I still think it could be nicer and I'm not sure why it is so angry. Is this normal?",

We cut contact at the start of November and this past month I\u2019ve felt super depressed. But I\u2019m feeling better at the moment, I\u2019ve cleaned my room and it helped me to a lot to wake up to a nice cosy room instead of an absolute mess.\n\nI went out shopping with my dad yesterday, and when I was there I couldn\u2019t stop myself from imagining him in front of me, like when I\u2019d meet up with him I would go up to him and he\u2019d give me the biggest hug and he just made me feel so safe and loved and it\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve experienced before. \n\nAnd not trying to sound crazy but we would take ecstasy together and I swear on everything we could communicate telepathically. And he only just started introducing me to his theories about how the government has been conditioning us etc. Like I\u2019ve always known the government is bad and brainwashes us but he actually explained everything and I would just sit there high out my mind, it was so interesting to listen to. Like he would go on about giants or flat earth and everything else they lied to us \n\nAnyway it\u2019s all my fault we stopped talking, we  had a big age gap (I\u2019m 16 he\u2019s a looot older) and I got mad at him once and snitched and now we have no contact. Idk man he said all the time he feels like we\u2019re soulmates and we connected so fast and I feel like I\u2019ll never have that close romantic connection with anyone else\n\nI kept all his pictures and I genuinely just daydream about him while looking at them. I\u2019m even trying to manifest him back or at least trying to talk to him telepathically. Lol",

          "content": "It seems to me that after every realization I have, the more trouble I have getting full night of sleep. I never have trouble falling asleep but most times I wake up after 4-5 hours and cannot fall back asleep. Interesting thing is that I feel rested and don\u2019t feel tired the next day, despite not drinking caffeine. I\u2019m only 24, and I eat healthy, exercise daily, so I don\u2019t see any reason why this should be happening.\n\nInteresting thing though is that the dramatic decrease in sleep duration occured around 6 months ago, exactly by the time I started to make a lot of progress with new meaningful realizations about nature of things almost daily. I used to sleep 8-9 hours before, and now after becoming more \u201cawake\u201d it seems like my body just doesn\u2019t want to sleep anymore.\n\nDoes anyone have similar experience? Or do you think this might just be a coincidence and I should see a doctor?",

I just graduated and am dealing with the change so I know thats a part of it. But the things I have had anxiety about and have feared and thought about so much are so bizzare that I cant tell if its just my anxiety or if im experiencing some sort of spiritual awakening. I havent done too much research on spiritual awakenings, so I cant tell. Im also a little bit of a skeptic, despite being a spiritual person. I believe that there is a connection between science and spirit, but also a balance between the two. Can someone please tell me that they've also gone through this? I feel like a child being born again. Gaining conciousness again. Like, I am realizing that I am a soul having a human experience. Whaaat?! I would and kiiinda still do have thoughts about death, whats after death, the purpose of human life, of life ifself, how time works, the universe and so on and so forth. I have thoughts about but also HEAVILY feared these things. Recently though my fear has gone down a little. Im starting to grow more interested in it and wanting to do more research. I was telling my sister about it and she just said \"let it happen\". Which yes, I dont believe the universe would work against me. But then again the universe wouldnt work against me as my soul. But what about me as a human being? Am I meant to die as a human being soon, like the horrible voice in my head says(theres so much more to this)? Idk. I know it may seem ridiculous. I want to be open and explore my spirituality even more. I know that it can be scary, but is it really THIS scary for others? I feel like Im the only one who goes through things like this. Everyone else whose shared on media their experiences has not said anything about this part. I hear about shadow people and going through rough patches in mental health. But not things like this. I feel very different then those around me. Most times its scary, but sometimes its comforting and interesting and I want to learn more. I want to lean into it. The fear is there holding me back tho, im told and convinced that the more I learn, the closer to (physical) death I am. I might also share, I have not been able to trust my intuition for the past almost 2 years. Im having a hard time trusting my intuition. Ive been doing yoga, I know thats helping me with my healing. Im seeing a therapist and healing my inner child. But what about everything else? I want to feel okay and live as a human being. Why is spiritual stuff so scary sometimes?",

I love others and I pray for those who hurt. I am not an angry person at my core. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that I need someone to tell me they\u2019ve healed from severe trauma. Tell me that one day, you woke up and you realized the past was washed away and you no longer live under the weight of its pain. \n\nTell me that and then tell me what I have to do to get to that point.",

          "content": "## It wasn't on a mountaintop, during a silent retreat, or even while meditating in a lotus pose. My spiritual awakening happened in the most mundane of places: my cluttered apartment, surrounded by the hum of the dishwasher and the glow of my laptop screen.\n\nI was working late, finishing up a deadline, when a wave of exhaustion washed over me. It wasn't just physical tiredness; it was a deep-seated weariness that seemed to seep into my very bones. In that moment, I felt utterly lost, disconnected from myself and the world around me.\n\nFrustrated and overwhelmed, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. And then, something unexpected happened. My thoughts, usually a swirling storm, began to quiet. The boundaries between myself and the room around me seemed to dissolve. It was as if I was merging with the air, the sounds, the very fabric of existence.\n\nTears streamed down my face, but they weren't tears of sadness. They were tears of profound gratitude, awe, and love. I felt a deep sense of interconnectedness, a knowing that I was part of something much larger than myself.\n\nMy perspective shifted from the individual to the universal. I saw the world through new eyes, filled with beauty, wonder, and possibility. My anxieties and fears, which had once loomed so large, now seemed insignificant in the face of this vast, interconnected reality.\n\nThat night, I didn't just go to sleep; I awoke to something new. It wasn't a destination, but a journey. A journey of self-discovery, of connection, and of living life with a newfound purpose.\n\nWhile my experience may not be typical, it's a testament to the fact that spiritual awakening can happen anywhere, anytime. It's not reserved for the yogis on mountaintops or the monks in monasteries. It's available to anyone who is open to it, willing to look within, and ready to surrender to the transformative power of the universe.\n\nAnd I stumbled upon [this article](https://medium.com/@Nsha_67/answering-the-call-a-beginners-guide-to-awakening-your-spiritual-potential-5d1f3188cc69) on [Medium.com](https://Medium.com).

For most of my life, I\u2019ve been able to \u201cmask\u201d this feeling of emptiness. Especially in social situations where I feel fragmented. It\u2019s like there\u2019s no solid self and I grasp until fragments to just get by in social situations. I always feel disconnected even around people I trust or like. \n\nThe only time I don\u2019t is when I\u2019m alone or in nature. During the pandemic, I moved back home, quit my corporate job, and basically hit the restart button on my life. A lot of shadow work too. Not that I had much of a choice I guess lol \n\nToday, I met with old friends for the first time since 2019. I felt really disconnected and empty once again. That sense of no autonomy came back and the loneliness hit. \n\nI also suspect I might be neurodivergent which contributes to some challenges socially. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t relax or be comfortable in my own skin. \n\nMy safe place is my inner world at home. But at the same time, I feel disconnected from the outer world and being bogged down in your subconscious isn\u2019t necessarily conducive. \n\nBut since the awakening, I\u2019ve felt more alone than ever. Or maybe just more aware? Is awakening suppose to be this painful? Anyone else have gone through this?",

Here they are:\n\n1. **The Law of Pure Potentiality**: This law is about understanding the essence of our being, which is pure consciousness. It suggests that recognizing and tapping into this source can lead to a life of true success.\n2. **The Law of Giving**: This law emphasizes that the universe operates through dynamic exchange. Giving and receiving are different aspects of the flow of energy in the universe, and a willingness to give what you seek can keep abundance circulating in your life.\n3. **The Law of Karma (or Cause and Effect)**: This law states that every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in kind. Choosing actions that bring happiness and success to others ensures the flow of happiness and success to you.\n4. **The Law of Least Effort**: This principle is about practicing acceptance and non-resistance. When your actions are motivated by love, and you expend the least effort, you tap into the infinite organizing power of the universe.\n5. **The Law of Intention and Desire**: This law is based on the fact that energy and information exist everywhere in nature. Human intention and desire, when grounded in this field of energy and information, have the power to orchestrate their own fulfillment.\n6. **The Law of Detachment**: This law suggests that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquish your attachment to it. This doesn't mean you give up the intention to create your desire, but you give up your attachment to the outcome.\n7. **The Law of Dharma (or Purpose in Life)**: According to this law, everyone has a purpose in life, a unique gift or special talent to give to others. When we blend this unique talent with service to others, we experience the ecstasy and exultation of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of all goals.\n\nThese principles aim to provide a spiritual foundation for material and personal success, emphasizing harmony with the universe and the importance of understanding and aligning with natural and spiritual laws.",

          "content": "This summer I went to work abroad in central Europe and I think I experienced my first spiritual awakening. I felt the universe and my soul intertwining, and all my worries were gone. I felt deep gratitude for everything in my life and I never needed even to remind myself to say to myself what I was greatful for. All my friends there were the same. Everything was amazing. \n\nWhen the semester at uni started in the beginning of september I went back to Sweden. I was nervous, due to the fact that I had no one to talk about this with and that everyone here is the same. They're not rude or anything, it's just that they never have ideas or thoughts that are about anything else than their house, their studies and what they'll to the coming weekend. In the beginning I didn't mind, I did my own thing. But now, in the beginning of december, I caught myself in the same tracks as them. I can't remember the last time I felt gratitude without anyone asking me what I'm grateful for or when I lost my connection to the universe. \n\nSince I live in southern Sweden one reason could be that I haven't seen the sun in a couple of weeks (I felt a deep connection to the sun during the summer). However there is nothing I can do about this, it will take two more months at least before the sun starts peeking out. \n\nHas anyone of you experienced this? How did you move on? I don't like feeling like I'm in the hamster wheel again: just running around chasing nothing of matter. Do you have any tips?",

I NEVER NEVER gave anyone there any right to do that. I am super low profile with good education and a really serious girl. I have never slept around in my whole life and i only care for meaninfull deep relationships/friendships.\n\nI was super calm when i called him out at first without swearing or being mad or anything i just let him know i know what he does so he would stop! But he DIDN'T he kept doing the same tactics again ana again, like i am an idiot ! So after that i literally slightly bullied him, i was talking to another women and telling stuff that he knew it was about him so he literally dissappeared and never saw him for 2 months. Then he came again and i pretend to talk to phone about him and swear EXTREMELY bad i literally belittle him as much as i could and then he disappeared for 4-5 months! And now he appeared again I KNEW that if i would not bully him he would annoy me and come around every day. And this exactly what he does. He literally changed the days he come to come when i go ! And i am started to get annoyed. Its like someone is clearly coming in front of my face and telling me that he wants to steal from me and like i do nothing! I don't agree with doing nothing cause it does not work! Plus even if i am not so mad now i know i will be cause they repeat (he and others but he is the worse) the same cycle again and again and again even if they see it does not work.\n\nI know it might not be the right sub for this (i don't think there is any sub actually for pimps) but i would like to read some replies that might help me.\n\nOne thing is sure if you leave them they will annoy you! Cause you give them space. And i cannot just tell him to not talk to me cause he does not talk. He just comes around or look at me from distance. If they were talking and just ask my phone it would be easy cause i would just tell them to not annoy. But even this would not work. Cause when i was mad cause one of them was staring at me he said he didn't and he keeps coming around like nothing happened! Nothing works with them. ",

I also now see shapes and very trippy designs but it\u2019s hidden behind the smoke so I\u2019ll see it only faintly, what does that mean? Also Last time I cried a lot, the smoke went away and I saw my body but it didn\u2019t have the face but had the head, I was more built and had dreads it seemed like and they were outlined blue. Now that before I could experience and experiment with it, I went through some trauma and the smoke came back, what is the meaning of crying to get the smoke to go away and the person staring back at me when I close my eyes? Idk what seeing the body is and if that controls the minds eye. I plan on taking edibles and thinking to myself \u201ccry\u201d over and over again bc last time I did, I tried bc I put myself into a sense of hypnosis very quickly and I cry like crazy when I never cry tbh. It works but I took time away from drugs but I plan on doing it after I take this drug test. Any help would help on what that body is and why crying gets rid of the smoke covering my visuals",

I have always been a little than more connected to my spiritual side no matter how realistic I force myself to be. My dreams have been on the extremes the last few months as well as almost daily very strong Deja vu. My intuition seems to be screaming at me more than usual as well. \n\nThis dream has been bothering me all day:\n\nFor backstory My little sister passed away at 5/o 10 years ago when I was 15. Allot has changed and my family adopted two other children. Last night I had a dream she came back, and it was wonderful but after a while I realized I couldn't find my adopted siblings. Turns out we could only have her or them. My mom decided to go with my little sister, and they walked away into a tunnel, and I was left behind with my two adopted siblings. It's been a while since I've had a dream this strong, and it's been affecting me all day. What does this mean?\n\nAlso, before my sister passed, I had reoccurring dreams of her passing away a certain way and she ended up passing away the same as my dreams very suddenly. Right before she got sick, she kept talking about a new imaginary friend and had a panic attack about what was going to happen to her toys when she passed (again not sick yet). During the short time she was in the hospital I had experience sleep paralysis of a figure in my room and after that she passed.\n\nI have had a lot more experiences of when my dreams become reality as well as my intuition proving to be correct, but these are the most significant.",

          "content": "I have been dealing with at least three evil spirits for several years now. I know I am schizophrenic, but I didn't simply label everything as an illusion. For in the universe, all thought it creation. I developed a way to guide myself through psychosis and other states. I would like to say that psychosis is a great opportunity to do deep work.\n\nI call my philosophy The Framework of Thought. A Frame is where our current attention is - it is the now. (Moving faster than 60 frames per second.) For every frame there is the subject, and then there is the context. It is in understanding the context of frame that we begin to peer into the depths of our subconscious mind. \n\nAnother key factor is looking into the metaphysics of determining what creates good and bad energy. For this, we must examine the hearts response to frame. I have this down to three questions. The hearts response is determined by 1. Whether is it true or not. 2. Whether it is good or bad. 3. Whether it relates to you. For each of these three there is an emotional reaction based on the response.\n\nSo in psychosis, if it is not true it can be dismissed. Whether it is good or bad ultimately determines the difference between dopamine or cortisol. Whether it relates to you or not is also used by the ego to decide if it can dismiss what is happening. It is important to recognize that good or bad energy is literally our hearts response to the determination of if something is good or bad. It's that simple.\n\nIt is in changing the context that evil entities are able to condition us without us knowing. We are only looking at the subject unaware of the context, and thus they change the context (in ways that are not true) so that they can condition us with negative associations in an attempt to control our thinking. There is a simple solution to this. Examine the context. \n\nWhenever a negative association or trigger arises, instead of being conditioned to react negatively and run away from the idea all together, it is better to examine the context to then make the idea produce positive emotion. This can be done by addressing assumptions, developing deeper insight, looking at the idea from different angels, understanding other shoes better, or even alternative story telling based on positive assumptions that changes the way you feel about the subject. \n\nIf you understand this you understand the difference between your own personal heaven or hell. By auditing yourself according to the above, you can reprogram your subconscious to produce positive energy. Every single thought and emotion is stored in the subconscious, so it's important to really know that everything you are exposed to will end up as programming in the subconscious. Create positive associations with as many ideas as possible in the \"now\" before you let them go.\n\nI have a lot of details involved and notes for my actual philosophy. However, I believe the above is the most important parts that piece it together roughly in order to make the philosophy (understanding) as actionable as possible. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions!  \n",

          "content": "So I got a sound bowl two years ago for my 18th birthday but I never found the time to use it. Then a few months ago I was looking into sound therapy to reduce the programming of music on my brain (In my religion music is banned) and so i realized the sound bowl can produce binaural beats naturally in contrast to the computer generated binaural beats.\n\nI was using the sound bowl simply for experimenting with potent frequencies on my brain, but what I found next was nothing short of a miracle in my eyes.\n\nYou see I\u2019ve been suffering from auditory and visual hallucinations for a hot minute now, and soon the more I started striking the sound bowl, the more it began to neutralize the hallucinations as it overpowered the noise in my brain. It\u2019s weird, it\u2019s like the binaural beats are digging deep within my mind and cancelling out all the noise it produces.\n\nThere is something psychological about sound therapy that taps into the unseen parts of the mind in where hallucinations are produced. My conspiracy theory behind it is that my brain produces low frequencies that I cannot hear that spawns the hallucinations. And so when I play potent healthy frequencies it taps into the root cause of the hallucinations, essentially nipping it in the bud.\n\nThis has been an amazing coping mechanism for my schizophrenia and I\u2019ve likened it to a fidget toy for people with adhd. This is like a spiritual fidget toy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nI hope this knowledge benefits you in some way. I am currently writing a 40 day journal on the sound therapy and it\u2019s going by really well.\n\nThanks for reading! Have a wonderful day.",

The basic message is there never was an individual and regardless of what is experienced there is already everything which is whole, or wholeness, and is already free from the need for anything to happen and so is complete, there's just absolute freedom, and it\u2019s the experience of being an individual which covers that over or hides it. But then another thing that also helped is that it can't be ruled out that there is not an intelligence that is the universe or all energy and therefore includes 'us' so we are that intelligence and that is who we really are, again we were never an individual and we were always the oneness and are just as much everyone and everything else as much as the body we are looking from.

Truly deeply unconditionally loved.\n\n\n And you don\u2019t have to \u201cbe a good person\u201d to receive this love at any time.\nAll you must do is to fully and selflessly wish to receive this love. One truly effective way to do this is to practice gratitude mantras day and night, especially when your  mind can be on autopilot (for instance when driving a highway, or doing the dishes). \nSomething as simple as \u201cdear God /Goddess/ thank you so much for all of this love and these blessings that are coming to me. Thank you Goddess.\u201d\n\nYou can Even pick a mantra in a different language if it speaks to you.\n\nDo this for 30 days, and you will start to see your life transform in ways you can\u2019t even imagine.\n\nBut the sad truth is that most reading this post won\u2019t stop to change something small in their daily lives to becoming the person they were intended to become.\n\nBe more. You can do it. I believe in you. God believes in you.",

Consequently, the rest of my life is not as well. I am 28 currently. My body is in poor shape and seems to be decaying. It has become unsightly. I have little ambition in the material world and most of my days are spent doing nothing but thinking while at home and so I still work minimum wage. And I am deeply troubled by experiences I have had in the past week, roughly.\n\nI had an experience the other day that was so intense it brought me to tears and each day past this I have been deep in thought contemplating the things I have come upon, which troubled me so much in the awe i had at them that i wouldnt dare even speak them, and feel paranoid even thinking them now. The fear that I have is this. The material world I am living in, I am becoming increasingly aware, is reflecting the spiritual struggles I am having. And it almost feels like the people around me can see them. It stresses me out at work to the point that I nearly have to stop altogether.\n\nOn the one hand, I am awed at the newfound feelings that are developing in me. On the other, I am deeply troubled by the sense that I am being courted by different forces, spiritually, but am unable to discern what is what, but there is a call that I should wake up and start acting out in the flesh and this makes me afraid. I feel as if, if I choose wrong, I will be destroyed. I feel like despite the people around me giving me constant affirmations, I am secretly despised. I feel like I can smell myself intensely and it as an unpleasant scent but am assured by others that they can not smell a thing. I had a disturbing experience today. I had an intense moment of spiritual trouble at work, and then things around me started getting weird. My coworker became almost dazed and wouldn't speak when I responded to her and looked at me in some sort of odd 'knowing' way, referring to the things happening in my mind. At the store tonight, a woman stopped in the aisle in front of me and stood with her mouth gaping, staring at me, even after I said hello. She was just stunned. \n\nI live in Los Angeles and part of me feels like I just want to run away as fast as I can, but part of me feels like I am a prisoner in the flesh here. I feel like I am having some kind of psychotic episode and yet I am totally lucid. Not sure what else to say or what I am looking for in response. Thanks.",

          "content": "Hello all, peace and blessings. Over the last couple years, I\u2019ve gotten deeper into my meditation and spiritual practices. For roughly a month or two now, I\u2019ve been seeing angel numbers EVERYWHERE. There have been days where I\u2019ve seen almost every single repeating number\u2014via the clock, license plates, street addresses and even on someone else\u2019s phone when I happened to look down at an outing. \n\nWhile out at the bar or social events-I\u2019ve seen angel numbers tattooed on people that walk right by me. If I recall, one night I saw 1111 222 555 444 888 all via tattoos on different people. \n\nThese occurrences were strange at first but I\u2019ve seen it so often that it\u2019s become a new norm. However, recently I\u2019ve started to hear angel numbers. Literal synchronicities in normal everyday conversations. A couple of the major real life examples I\u2019ve experienced are:\n\n 1. Walking into a restaurant to pick up some carry out and at that moment hearing the waitress call out a ticket number to the back she says \u201cThe next ticket roundup is set for the kitchen, start with ticket \u2018333\u2019.. oh sorry I meant \u2018222\u2019\u201d.  My thoughts: out of all the possible number combinations what are the chances those two ticket #s are called. At that exact moment.\n\n2. This occurred a half hour ago and was the inspiration for this question/post. \nI\u2019m taking an Uber back and the driver is telling me about her day and how she didn\u2019t sleep at all. She said \u201cMy husband had me up binge watching this show. It was like 15 episodes and it finally ended at 2:22\u201d\nMy thoughts: she could\u2019ve said any time any variation of times. Also how did she remember such a specific time, instead of saying \u201clike or around 2\u201d\n\nThese instances were so attention grabbing that it literally froze me in place. I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s no such thing as coincidences or happenstance. Especially within the understandings of spirituality. These signs are so profound and constant. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t been able find one question on hearing angel numbers in this manner. It\u2019s just the usual inquiries on seeing them and their meanings.\n\nDoes anyone else have experience in receiving spiritual messages in this manner?",

I know the world is a scary place right now, but remember: there\u2019s a reason why we are all, so many of us, waking up at this moment in time. We are here for a reason; we have purpose. That purpose is to raise our consciousness, raise our vibrations, and in turn raise the vibration of all of humanity  to usher in a new, golden age on earth. The old, rigid systems are putting up a fight as they gasp their final breaths. By raising our vibrations, we can make sure that the old is replaced by a new that works for all of us. \nWe are all connected; not just people but all of nature, and by always choosing Love and light over fear and darkness, by listening to the True self over the small self, we can save this world. Imagine it: a world where there is no violence, poverty,  hatred. No giving all our precious time away to miserable jobs just so we can survive. Where everyone\u2019s needs are met, and people all live in peace and harmony, and have the time and support to learn who they really are, to achieve their full potential. We are all capable of so much. Imagine it, Believe in it, and we will manifest it with our collective will. That is all! Love and peace always.",

Compared to just being, and being with the flesh I instead will feel like a part of my being without the body, and feel as if I'm kind of just in a pretend body suit. When I feel this way I'll try and find the closest mirror and feel shocked at what I see. As if I had to remind myself who I am in the physical world. And I'll challenge this by looking deeply into my eyes. Into the iris, and then into the pupil and it never lasts too long because I'll get this unsettling feeling of what I'm witnessing deep into my core.\n Not that I'm scared, I don't believe there's anything to be afraid of there but it's like a part of my subconscious is trying to hold me back from realizing or feeling anything further. Compare this to a time of feeling \"normal\" which is majority of the time outside of these \"moments\", I can look myself in the mirror no problem and understand what I'm seeing is what I've always known to be and have become familiar with since gaining consciousness as a human. Nothing deeper than the flesh. No deeper thought about it, just more-so artificial and superficial thoughts that we're programmed to think when we see ourselves. But other times it feels like I'm seeing something that doesn't make sense in the physical world. I'm seeing something my eyes aren't supposed to see.\n\nYes I'm sober. I don't drink. Most I do is micro dose with mushrooms here and there. I'm not on medication or diagnosed with anything. I don't feel it's a mental issue because even with these feelings sometimes occurring, I'm genuinely a happy person naturally. But explain this to the everyday mind I'll be labeled crazy or th. dissociating",

Just a tiny bit but i couldnt stop it. My head was for 1 sekend presst to the back really strong. I still thought about everything that happend with us. I heard some noise from my apartment but i didn't want to stop. After som minutes it was like a golden lightning hit me... first i saw like a fog in the dark for the whole meditation. My 3. Eye was wide open when it happend. Then everything got golden and so bright that i had to open my eyes. I couldnt \"look\" at it. In the exact same moment my ps shut down that was on in the background. I nearly had a heartattack... does anyone know what that light was? And why did i got \"send home\"?  It didnt feel evil but rather strange..\n\nThank you all!",

Nothing matters, and yet, we continue to exist. \n\nRecently I've realized that nothingness and somethingness are indistinct; all matter is made of empty space and energy, which too, when frozen in time, is void. Physicality is an illusion. \"Nothing\" literally \"matters.\" \n\nBut what purpose does this serve if nothing matters, if everything is meaningless? Well, if nothing and everything are indistinct, and nothing matters, then everything simultaneously does and doesn't matter. I suppose it is a matter of perspective; which is why consciousness is divided, such that it may perceive a perspective (ego) that is capable of abstraction, deriving meaning. Death leads to rebirth, and the ego is no exception, for it is the will of the universe to perceive. \n\nAny other insights?",

          "score": 7,
          "author": "daniel_shkolnik",
          "content": "Over a year ago, I went through what I can only describe as an awakening experience, non-dual state, or \"spiritual emergence.\"\n\nPopular spiritual notions of \"awakening\" make it seem like it's the best thing that could possibly happen to you. What they don't mention is the psychological turbulence of premature awakening.\n\nAwakening is not about becoming morally perfect, healing the sick, or becoming all-knowing. Awakening is simply realizing our true nature: the felt sense that we are the cosmos, and the cosmos is us. This truth opens our heart to flowing love. It liberates us from our cramped personal identities. We become capable of immense compassion, free from attachment, and directly connected to the sacred nature of the universe. It is the central teaching of all mystical traditions.\n\nBut truly believing\u2014and living\u2014this truth can be frightening and destabilizing.\n\nA spiritual emergence can lead to what Stan Groff called a \"spiritual emergency.\"In an attempt to make sense of my own experience, I began seeking out and speaking to people who have had awakening experiences.They are far more common than I previously thought, and they can be far more challenging and destabilizing than I imagined.\n\nThree people I spoke with entered into psyche wards as a result of their awakening. One person experienced weeks to months of debilitating, nightmarish disillusionment. Saeed Khan, a consciousness teacher I spoke with, described how his awakening led to a prolonged state of clarity, after which he fell into intense depression before stabilizing himself. (I've had my own struggles integrating my experience, and I am grateful to Saeed and a few close friends for supporting me in challenging moments.)\n\nSaeed introduced me to the term \"stable awakening,\" and I feel like that hits the nail on the head. Stability is what's missing in discussions of awakening, and in the global spiritual culture more broadly.Moving forward, I am committing to speak openly and clearly about my experience of awakening. This is for two reasons:\n\n1. Living from a place of awakened consciousness may be the single most important shift we can make in our lives and for our world.\n2. This shift can be immensely confusing and difficult without support.\n\nThe mental health system (and psychology in general) aims to create ego-stability. It has virtually no frameworks for ego-transcendence, and as a result pathologizes awakening / emergence. According to Christina and Stanislav Grof:... many of the conditions, which are currently diagnosed as psychotic and indiscriminately treated by suppressive medication, are actually difficult stages of a radical personality transformation and of spiritual opening. If they are correctly understood and supported, these psychospiritual crises can result in emotional and psychosomatic healing, \\[and\\] remarkable psychological transformation.\n\nPsychology tries to strengthen and secure the ego. And while strengthening the ego is a valuable first step to transcending the ego, it only gets us so far.\n\nAs a result of my experience, a focus of my work has become studying and helping others achieve stable awakening or stabilize an awakening they're already going through.I've helped several people navigate difficult awakening experiences. In particular, those who come from non-religious backgrounds or who may not seek out traditional Buddhist, Hindu, or non-dual religious teachers. I am not a spiritual master, but I can offer psychological and spiritual tools that will better prepare people for and stabilize an awakening.\n\nIf you or someone you know is going through a difficult awakening experience and are looking for some help, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to be a resource for those who need it. I can also connect you with other enlightenment teachers, like Saeed and others, whom I've worked with and trust.\n\nAs Ram Dass said, 'we are all just walking each other home.'",

I acknowledged my body and everything I was feeling, my heartbeat and how I was breathing. I acknowledged my emotions, and the pain and hurt I have been feeling, the anger and frustration. And I just started praying and talking to God about how lost and confused I feel. Then I started reciting positive affirmations of the things I want to feel, and I just felt this release. It started in my chest, like a knot that was growing in my chest, and I just kept reciting the positive affirmations. The knot in my chest got tighter, and I started crying, but I didn\u2019t stop and I just allowed myself to feel what I was feeling in that moment. I\u2019m new to all this spirituality stuff, I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but whatever it is that just happened to me felt really good.",

I will bathe you with herbs, I will purge you, and you will vomit the rage and the darkness inside you. I'll press your body with good herbs, and I'll put you to lay in the grass, face up to the sky. Then I will breathe into your crown to clean the old memories that make you repeat the same behavior.*\n\n*I will breathe into your forehead to scare away the thoughts that cloud your vision. I will breathe into your throat to release the knot that won't let you talk. I will breathe into your heart to scare fear, so that it goes far away where it cannot find you. I will breathe into your solar plexus to extinguish the fire of the hell you carry inside, and you will know peace.*\n\n*I will breathe with fire into your belly to burn the attachments, and the love that was not. I will breathe away the lovers that left you, the children that never came. I will breathe into your heart to make you warm, to rekindle your desire to feel, create and start again. I will breathe with force into your loins, to clean the sexual door to your soul.*\n\n*I will breathe away the garbage that you collected trying to love what did not want to be loved. I will use the broom, and the sponge, and the rag, and safely clean all the bitterness inside you. I will breathe into your hands to destroy the ties that prevent you from creating. I will breathe into your feet to dust and erase the footprints memories, so you can never return to that bad place.*\n\n\n*I will turn your body, so your face will kiss the earth. I'll breathe into your spine from the root to the neck to increase your strength and help you walk upright. And I will let you rest.*\n\n\n*After this you will cry, and after crying you will sleep, And you will dream beautiful and meaningful dreams, and when you wake up I'll be waiting for you. I will smile at you, and you will smile back. I will offer you food that you will eat with pleasure, tasting life, and I will thank you. Because what I\u2019m offering today, was offered to me before when darkness lived within me. And after I was healed, I felt the darkness leaving, and I cried.*\n\n\n*Then we will walk together, and I will show you my garden, and my plants, and I will take you to the fire again. And will talk together in a single voice with the blessing of the earth. And we will shout to the forest the desires of your heart. And the fire will listen and whisper the echo, and we will create hope together. And the mountains will listen and whisper the echo, and we will create hope together. And the rivers will listen and whisper the echo, and we will create hope together. And the wind will listen and whisper the echo, and we will create hope together.*\n\n\n*And then we will bow before the fire, and we will call upon all the visible and invisible guardians.*\n\n\n*And you will say thank you to all of them.*\n\n*And you will say thank you to yourself.*\n\n*And you will say thank you to yourself.*\n\n*And you will say thank you to yourself.\"*\n\nAlexander Khimushin: Udege grandma.

This has been going on a few weeks now with no other symptoms or feeling sick in any other way. I recently went to the Dr. to make sure I had no health issues and I do not. I never get hot like this durning the day. The only thing I can think of is some kind of ascension symptoms. I\u2019ve had some major breakthroughs lately in some traumas and limiting beliefs work so maybe it\u2019s that? This has happened to me in the past before and lasted a short time since my journey started but never this severe or for this long. I can\u2019t find anything about this problem online. Most articles will bring up hormonal hot flashes but looking in to typical hot flashes symptoms, this is not what I feel like is going on. Has anyone else had this issue on their journey? Any ideas on what it could mean? Kundalini energy rising maybe? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Thank you.",

I felt an overflow of emotion when she removed her hand and then 5 minutes later she announced to me she is pregnant?!!!!!\n\n-me and gf were driving through an affluent neighborhood and I was looking at the houses and manifesting a life that looked like the one I was seeing; we passed house number 1818 and I googled the angel number to find out that it means \u201cyour angels want you to move in the direction of prosperity and abundance\u201d. \n\nAll of this being said, I have been feeling strange. I have this heavy feeling of angst that will not go away- like I am meant to be pursuing something that I am not aware of yet or like I need to travel somewhere for something? It\u2019s like the universe is trying to lead me somewhere but I wasn\u2019t given a map or instructions. \n\nYesterday my girlfriend and I were out and about and she randomly suggested we visit a crystal shop. We wandered into a nearby joint and the woman who owned the shop felt like someone I needed to connect with. Prior to entering the shop, my gf and I sat in the car talking and I mentioned that the neighborhood we were in had very high vibrational energy. \n\nWhen we entered the shop, The older English woman was speaking with us and she basically said verbatim that \u201cshe loves this area because it\u2019s very high vibration\u201d. My jaw dropped. \n\nThis woman had the most peaceful, calming energy I had ever encountered. We spoke very briefly, but in the time that we spent talking she shared things with me that impacted me heavily. I wanted to listen to her talk forever. She also made VERY random comments about past trauma and how these are things we have to accept and let go of, but it felt like she was reading me and providing intuition hand tailored for me somehow.\n\nI think the reason that this interaction was significant to me is because I have met many people who claim to be spiritual or enlightened in some way, but I find it\u2019s often very superficial \u201cspirituality\u201d which is not honed yet. I remember speaking with a priest about spiritual experiences that I was having and he basically told me that I\u2019m looking for things that aren\u2019t there.\n\nAnyway, this whole interaction felt magical. Now I\u2019m just here evaluating my whole life trying to figure out why I think this woman from the shop is meant to be my spiritual guide or something.i have not been able to stop thinking about the crystal shop or the woman since yesterday. I hardly know her. Do I sound crazy? Someone help me out here because I\u2019m not too sure how to proceed. How can I figure out what I am meant to be doing ?",

However, now that we're past Thanksgiving, I'm feeling reluctant to embrace the winter season as the \"Christmas/holiday\" season because of all the stress that comes with it. I'm absolutely not ready to force myself to be jolly and giving when I'm not feeling that way. I think a lot of society's problems have stressed me enough to not have the energy to. \n\nWith where our society is today, I feel a split between consumerism vs spiritualism and the shift of people realizing how material \"bargains\" are just scams at this point. I'm also finding it stressful that the people around me are more prone to materialism than I am but I think what's stressing me more is that they want things to continue as they did in the past as if nothing is different and that nothing is changing. I know that not everyone is gonna be where I'm at with this but I wish I had the energy to try to help them understand. \n\nWith all that said, I'm having a rough time deciding my place with my efforts of gifting things this year whether it be store-bought or handmade, overthinking about who deserves what from me and if it's even worth the effort and if they would even appreciate or make use of the gift. Money is definitely a factor in the stress and I'm hesitating at making any consumerist move at all. I feel like pinching pennies is more important or worthwhile than spending on loved ones who will have expected more from me. \n\nI guess I'm seeking validation in the sense that I may not be alone with how I'm feeling. Being on this journey on my own makes me feel lonely from time to time which I think lowers my vibration and makes life feel harder than it should. I know we're here to learn and to make the most out of our existence but I'm feeling stuck where I am at with my life and that nothing is really moving forward.

          "content": "*this post contains an experience of a Native American menstruation ritual I tried years ago and am curious if anyone can relate or provide more insight*\n\nHello everyone. After at least a decade of deprioritizing anything having to do with spirituality, I feel my spirit stirring again. It feels good to acknowledge that while also holding space for some fear and anxiety. I really struggled with my initial spiritual awakening as I felt like I teetered on the line of psychosis at times. After two years (19-21 yrs old) of what felt like an internal spiritual all out war and insanity, I managed to put down the fight and do my best to live a normal grounded life, which I have until recently (33). After a few recent lucid dreams, I am once again preoccupied mainly by one profound experience I had when I was about 20. And it occurred while committing to a Native American menstrual ritual during the first day of one cycle. \n\nIt may or may not be relevant to some that I point out that I have Apache ancestry about 15% from my dads side. But I wasn\u2019t raised with this tradition. I once took a class on Native American history while in college and was learning about different rituals/traditions. I learned about \u201cMoon Time Lodge\u201d which is a time for women to retreat, relax, meditate, and perhaps go on a vision quest during menstruation. Forgive me for forgetting the specifics of variations amongst tribes, but some were communal rituals and others were solitary rituals. Either way, this time was treated as very spiritually powerful and even ripe for visionary experiences. I was extra fascinated by this tradition because since I was 13 I\u2019ve had excruciating periods (endometriosis being common among women on my dads side) where I\u2019m truly incapacitated even from speaking/walking. I\u2019m able to manage it with preemptive measures, but if I miss that small window, it\u2019s rather hopeless for a day. With no expectations whatsoever of a vision quest, I thought I\u2019d try a solitary day of meditation while on my period with simple goals of healing and rest.  \n\nThe rules were: no technology, no contact with anyone whatsoever, it\u2019s best to not even have the opportunity to glance at or hear another person, and to try and do only passive activities. I took one normal dose of ib prophen to prevent a full blown episode and that\u2019s basically what I did. I was home for the summer, so my parents were home at night but I was pretty much able to achieve total isolation although I maybe heard them speak once or twice. I prepared all the food I would eat for the day so I didn\u2019t even have to leave my room (bathroom when no one was around) Anyway the day went by really fast and I was just straight chillin in peace. Minimal pain. And It\u2019s actually surprising I didn\u2019t get bored in hindsight especially with no technology. I felt like I read, laid around and it was time for bed.\n\nThis is where the experience begins though. I fall asleep and I feel like I immediately wake up INTO a lucid dream. I have no body and everything around me is completely white. It feels like pure consciousness but I\u2019m still me, just a very raw pure form of me. It was so pleasantly content I can\u2019t even put into words. There was love emanating but it wasn\u2019t overwhelming. There was a calmness to it. Then I slowly become aware of a woman\u2019s presence who is somehow to my right even though we don\u2019t have bodies. I\u2019m really happy to feel her, she seems familiar. She brings my attention to a male presence who is to my left and the energy drops. I\u2019m not so happy to feel him there. Mind you during this time I\u2019m becoming a little more like my earthly self. A little less raw and little more textured. And I kind of think to myself \u201cugh what\u2019s he doing here\u201d and he feels very sad, sorry, almost pathetic. And I do feel bad but it was also such a downer from where I was at. And the woman\u2019s presence asked me telepathically \u201cdo you forgive him\u201d and I bring my attention back to the male presence and he\u2019s telepathically asking me to punish him, to reciprocate what he did to me. But my mind couldn\u2019t even process or know or remember who he was or what he did even tho he was so unpleasantly familiar. I feel like he might be a repressed memory. In my typically avoidant fashion i \u201csaid\u201d to her \u201cyeah sure\u201d almost trying to rush him out of there without really absolving either of us of anything. The woman then emanated a slight sense of the most compassionate disappointment  and I instantly fell to earth in physical form.\n\nHer invisible presence is still with me after i plummeted to the ground almost comically. and there\u2019s a little jar of \u201cpotion\u201d and she guides me to drink it. She telepathically tells me that \u201cinternal chaos\u201d will now ensue and that I will die, and that my goal is to be \u201cat peace\u201d at the moment of death and to just go about my life and maybe to visit some people before it happens. Meanwhile, I\u2019m actually still glowing and radiating some of that light consciousness from the white space like kinda high from it. And I\u2019m just like \u201cyou bet no problem piece of cake, catch you in the white space\u201d she leaves and now I\u2019m on my way to have a day with the knowledge I\u2019m gunna die pretty soon. It then becomes a lot less lucid where I\u2019m visiting friends and stuff like that. But then at the very end my childhood best friend says to me \u201chey G, don\u2019t you have to catch a flight?\u201d And then suddenly I remembered im going to die soon and anxiety started to set in. I thought to myself I don\u2019t want to die on a plane. I want to die on the the ground. I realize I\u2019m failing the mission by not being at peace and i start to spiral. I take out a paper and pen and I write this letter verbatim \u201cto my friends and family, this all happened for a reason. Blessings and please believe\u201d except I could NOT write the word believe, I kept crossing it out, not liking the way it looked, spelling it wrong etc. then suddenly I finished the word once and for all and I woke up, cartoonishly jolted out upright, sweating, heart racing.\n\nI know I may have failed but I still feel healed in a way by this experience, but like there is so much more work to do. Im so grateful for that white space. I\u2019m revisiting this experience and I want to ask you all if you have any experience with this realm and/or tradition. Any and all insight is welcome. Thank you so much for reading my story. It feels really good to share it. I am even considering finding a way to research this this phenomena during menstruation in a real way. It feels so accessible. \n\nWith love",

          "content": "My name is Tirtha,\n\nI am a lifelong monk, and I want to share my story. Since monks don\u2019t usually do that, I thought maybe this would inspire someone or at least would be interesting.\n\nI always believed in God. Although my family wasn\u2019t very religious, I was raised as a Christian and ever since I was a little kid I always longed for a personal connection with God. I wanted Jesus to be my friend, I wanted Him to talk to me. I was praying and looking for Him, but I could not find Him. I could not find peace in my prayers.\n\nIn my early teens, I still considered myself a Christian, but doubts and questions about my faith entered my heart. I had questions that could not be answered. The more I asked the more confused I got. Instead of answers I received chastisement, \u201cHave faith in God\u201d and etc. The history of the Christian Church didn\u2019t increase my faith either. Gradually, I started looking for answers elsewhere. \n\nGrowing up I didn\u2019t have real friends; nobody could understand my heart. In school and in parties I would always put on a mask. I would pretend to be one of cool kids. I would hang out with the popular kids just because I was afraid of missing out. But very quickly I started to see how meaningless the things that \u2018cool kids\u2019 cared about were: wealth, popularity, status, external beauty, and so on\u2026 As I got older, my so-called friends started noticing that I was different. Although did really well in school I didn\u2019t want what society was pushing down my throat (9-5 job, family, kids) either. \n\nI have never had sex, drunk alcohol or smoked in my life, although I was surrounded by people who were always engaged in drinking, smoking, parties, drugs, sex, sleep, repeat. Maybe I was a drunkard in my past life, because I never judged others. But in my heart, I had a conviction that I would never try any of those things. Eventually, my so-called friends got tired of me. I became like a thorn to them\u00ad\u2013 me not smoking or drinking made them feel guilty. I stopped going to parties and they stopped inviting me. Now I was alone, but I didn\u2019t have to pretend anymore, I felt liberated. It felt like a wake-up call from God, as if He wanted me to follow find my true self. \n\nI felt a calling inside my heart. God was calling me. He was waiting for His lost child. But I couldn\u2019t find him. I needed a way to communicate with him, but I couldn\u2019t speak His language. I always had great respect for anyone trying to advance on their spiritual path, but I couldn\u2019t find my own path. So far, the languages I knew felt incomplete. I couldn\u2019t fully express myself.\n\nIn my late teens I started exploring Eastern religions. Buddhism helped me a lot, yet still, after hours of meditation, I would ask myself, \"Why? Why am I doing this?\" Something was missing. I didn\u2019t want to annihilate my soul and be nothing. I wanted a relationship with the Supreme, impersonal philosophy was too dry for me. I wanted something more personal like Christianity.\n\nThis is when I met the Hare Krishnas and came to their temple. Who would have thought right? \u2026 I had seen Hare Krishnas before, dancing and singing on the streets. But I had never read about their philosophy, I thought that they are just crazy happy people. Turns out I was right, they are crazy, and they are happy. But they are crazy and happy for God. In the temple, Hare Krishna devotees introduced me to the bhakti yoga philosophy and I felt that I finally found my place\u2026 Words can\u2019t explain what I felt there. My heart was melting. It felt as if I was finally home. I won\u2019t even try to explain what experiences I had in that temple. My heart was captured, God stole my heart, and I don\u2019t think I will ever get it back\u2026\n\nNow, for the last few years, I have lived in a temple in NY and traveled all over the world, I have found my path, God called me, and I answered \u2013 I became a monk. His call was so powerful that I gave Him everything and have taken vows of celibacy.\n\nI hope that everyone will find their path. I know that God is calling everyone, He is waiting for us. Everyone has a different relationship with God. There are so many paths, but the goal is one. We are all children of God. Like rivers meet in the ocean we all will meet in His Kingdom. Yet each river is different, it has its own beauty and specialty. Each path is different, but isn\u2019t that beautiful?\n\nIf anyone has any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate and ask me privately.",

No one seems to want to be around me because I can't go 5 minuteswithout correcting someone's behaviors or call in out their lies and deception either to them selves or to others. Being around people who lie manipulate or are self centered makes me so angry. And constantly having to correct the same people over the same things Is killing me. I dont want to be around anyone but that's not an option for me. Even though my anger is a direct response to how other people are behaving I'm the one labels with \"a problem\". I'm the one who needs to change. And it's unfair. I don't know what to do. All I ask is for everyone to treat others the way they would want to be treated and by trying to get everyone to see their own behavior is making everyone not want to be around me. I feel like I can call \" it\" out of people. The darkness or ego or what ever u want to call it. The parasite living within all of us. And I can't help myself but to correct it. I just want to feel normal again. I don't know who I am or what I'm even doing here. To find the answer, to see the light, to feel it within myself, then shif into this dark reality. It feels like a bad dream. How could something so positive and bright end up making me so empty and lonely? Can anyone please help with some guidance. Ty",

When you successfully do so, you regain the ability to feel euphoria all over your body and for long durations with a second practice, the selfhack, that is basically the conscious movement of your \"spiritual energy\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only is this spiritual energy the very essence of the positive emotions in the physical body it's in every thing in nature. After gaining control of this, the euphoric feeling everywhere on my body / the levels off it have just been truly ecstatic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is that positive energy that can most easily be felt/recognized as present while you get goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli. Eventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of positive energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps to  then feel it over your whole body and increase its duration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis energy has been researched and documented under many names Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Intent, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, The Tingles, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested in taking control of your energy and feel euphoria on-demand I made these [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/)  explaining how you can also use this selfhack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Everyone feels this energy at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on and those are exactly the people you can find on [r/Spiritualchills](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/) where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on how-to induce it to counteract stress or feel euphoria on-demand.",

I started to have dejavu after this day and it hasn't stopped. I have suffered anxiety and depression for a long time but after this everything got so much worse. I began to have spiritual experiences where I felt pulled internally and like something (many somethings) were talking to me inside of my mind.  I began to have flashbacks and slowly began to recall the spiritual encounter that Thanksgiving night. I lived through the book of revelations along with other biblical prophecy. I recall speaking to angels and having visions from Isaiah. I had never read these books before that night. I remember being visited by someone or something who explained my life and why everything is happening on earth and the purpose behind it all. My memories are still cloudy from that night but when I'm laying in bed late at night I'll still have memories from that night flash through my mind. When I'm going about my day to day I experience moments with others that I was told would happen but when I was told I wasn't shown who or faces just conversations. Now when it happens sometimes I'll hear a very quiet voice inside say \"this is an important moment. Remember this and who it is\". I have met one other person who has had dreams and visions like I have that are completely biblical but im still confused by it all. Its like my life is now slowly moving to the end on my vision (pure joy, happiness, love, forgiveness, and celebration) and don't know how long this will keep going on for until I experience clarity. I'm wondering if anyone has ever had or heard of something similar. Ever since this began I was pulled back to Christ and his sacrifice but before this I turned so far away from Christianity I looked almost everywhere else for answers to life to find the meaning of it all. I oddly have a sense of peace and surrender through it all yet I still wish I could go back to that night and remember the dreams vividly and remember who I was talking to clearly instead of fragmented memories.",

I gave up weed, phone addiction, porn addiction, excessive junk food, getting zoned out in video games, tv, etc.\n\nI developed insomnia at this time.

I believe I can play video games for a couple of hours on a Friday night in a healthy detached way, but my guides disagree.\n\nThey seem to be very blunt in their stance that I need to continue on my spiritual path and not get sucked into material desires. They indicate I am not learning my karmic lessons. And that fear is holding me back from moving forward on my path.\n\nI get it and see the truth in their message but at the same time, so what?

It's hard to explain to a psychiatrist that you're being attacked by \"beings\" without being labeled a schizophrenic. Even now I'm on meds because I lost that fight. I have lost everything because of this awakening and the spiritual attacks which after 3 years haven't stopped. I'm losing steam in this fight. I was completely unprepared and vulnerable because I was only 19 when I woke up. Thank you, any advice or personal experiences so I feel less alone would be much appreciated. ",

Felt the connection come back new it wasn\u2019t coming from me, got over it. Few days later BOOM kundalini awakening. (Just realized what it was) but idk if it\u2019s still going on. Sometimes I think it\u2019s over, and it all flares up again. The more I lean away from it, the harder it hits when I go through another wave of it. Can anyone relate ? This is another part where I just wanna put all of this down. It\u2019s not even about my twin anymore. Idc what he does or if he comes back. But I\u2019m confused about how this all works because I think I\u2019m still going through it. But I know when you see through, you can\u2019t see back. Also this has been happening for well over almost 2 months now. So I think I got a good grip on what this is. And I\u2019m asking because I\u2019m kinda watching my whole reality crumble again. Because I do not think the same as I did. So nothing I did makes sense now. Shallow people or jobs I was entertaining. But still so fucking confused. No hate please! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc ",

You can alter your body and stuff, lose the weight, or whatever u plan to do. 100 years passed and you arent done with everything in the world, you are oblivous to what people dont know in the jungles of land in brazil or the skid row of La. so you set out more 1000 years to uncover it all. You arent done. but fuck it live social right now you have all the time right? 200,000 years passed. done it all? nahh. live in everywhere? yes. millions of years passed you probably meet damn aliens  haha. have you done it all? no. billions or trillions idk how time will work in the future, different? you realize, you cant do it all, human mind fully reaches 100% when they realize something is nothing, they havent been in nothing yet. So they wait. more centuries or thousands of years passed and its the end. the end? how can it be? no my wife, my generations of kids who probably rule the world because of my immortality of fame and power. its just you now. stuck alone wandering in the air of nothing. darkness. you live sad for a long long time, not fully accepting what happened. One day you accept the stuff that went on and still do you, you use your brain from all the knowledge you gathered from billions of research to think of something. your brain ponders hard as it thinks of the first moment you got immortality, you are 100% the key to life is immortality to live it all.

          "content": "\nHey everyone,\n\nAbout four months ago, during a psychedelic trip, I experienced a profound revelation. It was a moment where I truly saw myself for who I am. Reflecting on my life, I realized that I've been carrying the weight of childhood trauma, which manifested in many ways. From feeling like an outsider among peers to desperately seeking love and approval, my past haunted me.\n\nMy relationship with my parents wasn't always smooth, and that added to the cloud of darkness hovering over me. I became someone who sought validation through relationships, even if it meant settling for the wrong ones. Low self-esteem and a constant need to please others guided my actions.\n\nHowever, this journey wasn't all gloom. I've started putting myself first, learning to say \"no\" without guilt, and slowly breaking free from the chains of people-pleasing. The most significant lesson I've embraced is forgiving myself and accepting that the past is just that\u2014the past.\n\nThis journey of self-reflection has been transformative. I'm now on a path of self-love, healing, and acceptance. Every step I take toward prioritizing my well-being feels like a victory. How have you navigated similar journeys of self-discovery and healing? Would love to hear your experiences and insights.",

That this something (pure awareness) it cannot be identify but then calling it awareness is putting a label to it because words are play & it has to make sense to the mind. One day I listen to Mooji and he was telling a story of a man that wanted his suffering to stop and the person he went to get the answer from said to him \" Who is the one suffering if you are the one paying attention, You are not experiencing suffering, you are suffering your experiencing.\" how we feel inside has nothing to do with the actual experience it self but the thoughts that come along. Everyones name is \"i\" &  \" What we call the personality is often a jumble of genuine traits and adopted coping styles that do not reflect our true self at all but the loss of it.\" - Gabor",

Things are how they are regardless of how one feels about them but man the older I get the more I see how Unhealthy we live as a society. Theres just no way that we came here to work for corporations and be told what we can and cannot do by Governments that are rooted in greed. Some humans out here working 2+ Jobs just to make ends meet. Add to that the unrealistic expectations society creates and tries to impose on people. The lack of empathy humans have for one another is sad to say the least. So much stimulation everywhere, I remain optimistic regardless and always try to have a positive outlook on things but geez it's so unhealthy not just for Mental but physical body.",

The more I rise up in my awareness and ascension, the more \u201cawake\u201d I become, the more I am feeling energies all around me, which I know is normal and a positive sign, however I am feeling so strongly in my body the negative feelings or thoughts others might have towards me. If someone around me is upset with me about something, I know it! No matter how they act towards me I feel it physically. Some people, even people in my immediate family, when I am around them I shake, my body aches, negative thoughts start to swirl, and I feel as if Kano matter what I do, they HATE me\u2026 even if they are not saying it, it\u2019s a feeling, a vibration\u2026 so it\u2019s always right about when I\u2019m feeling great about my awakening and happy to be seeing signs and synchronicity that I\u2019m doing great\u2026 then bam.. I am around someone and I just can\u2019t help but feel like shit. Shit about myself, shitty in my body and my bones, thinking thinking thinking of what I could\u2019ve done to them to make them upset.. and I think to myself we always hear the outside world is a reflection of how we are feeling on the inside.. so is it true? Does that negative feeling come from me? And why is it only when I\u2019m around her that I feel this way? The person is my sister. I love her and she tries to be kind and usually is but I get a strong terrible feeling around her sometimes well lately most of the time. I feel ill intentions I suppose.. but I am unsure if these feelings are coming from me and she really does not have I\u2019ll feelings towards me or if she truly is just a bad seed and I don\u2019t want to admit it\u2026 Iwould like to note that I am a truly loving being.. I really just want the best for everyone including myself. Amy advice about these energies? Thanks so much",

          "content": "First I just want to give some context with my awakening experience thus far\u2026 I used to have some bad habits and I used to suffer a lot. I\u2019ve always struggled with various addictions and although in recent years I have been much better off, I still struggled with internet porn, smoking pot, numbing myself with video games and phone scrolling, eating junk food, etc. My marriage was at a boiling point and trust with my wife was blown. One day I decided to draw a card and that card was the Ten of Swords. It was basically interpreted at the time as: You\u2019re not a victim. You did this to yourself. Time to take responsibility. \n\nSometime later on, I made the decision that enough was enough. I stopped smoking pot. I gave up my smart phone for a flip phone. I started meditating daily, and things started to change. I came clean to my wife on the extent of my internet browsing habits and naturally just stopped playing video games.\n\nAt some point around this time I was directed by my teachers and guides to The Power of Now. Every single word of the book was heard and understood and that day I experienced a glimpse of awakening. I accessed \u201cthe Now\u201d and spent all day in it. It was like seeing the world for the first time again. After that day, the feeling slowly went away and since then I have been working closely with my guides on my path to an awakened life. \n\nDuring this experience I developed some level of insomnia that I found quite tough to handle at first. In time I learned to surrender and let go and have been managing much better. All of my hobbies and interests took a back seat to this process. All of my bad habits evaporated. \n\nMonths later I am at a point where I understand my addictions for what they were and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for them to come back. I have thoughts and can feel my ego trying to lure me at times but I don\u2019t believe them. Normalcy is returning in a sense, but things will never be the same. \n\nOne thing I continue to struggle with is understanding how to balance material interests with an awakened life without attachment? I feel like I\u2019m at a point where I can enjoy some of my material interests again but am unsure about a few things. I really do enjoy video games. I always have. My interest in them hasn\u2019t waned but I am hesitant to play because I feel like it is not in service of my higher self and I might be punished or something? I think ultimately I can play video games at some point again, I just need to learn of a different way to approach them. \n\nI have asked my guides through tarot a few times and seem to get mixed signals. Perhaps depending on where I\u2019m at mentally and spiritually at the time. Sometimes it\u2019s the 5 of Swords and do not pass, other times it\u2019s like do what energized and excites you!\n\nI have a fantasy hockey pool that I enjoy playing. I enjoy following my local team. I am trying to play the pool and enjoy it but without too much investment. If I\u2019m thinking about it all the time, or beating myself about a mistake or bad play, I feel like I\u2019ve lost the plot and need to take a step back and remind myself of the illusion. Is this the key? Enjoying material things but realizing that ultimately they are meaningless? Is moderation the key?\n\nHow can I get into, and follow a show I liked before? Is following and getting excited for next weeks episode not being attached? Looking forward to some upcoming down time in the future so I can relax and play video games? I guess I just don\u2019t understand how I can have a relationship with any material thing without some level of identification? Ultimately it is my personality that likes all these things?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read! I have never told anyone of my recent experience except for my wife. I would love to hear back from you all! Thank you!",

          "content": "Luxor is kinda somewhat real. I kinda or might have learned true psychological warfare from a voice in the air. Took a fucking while though. He kinda felt sorry for me after a while and we were slowly becoming friends so...He is the God of Psychological warfare, he can \"end\" his game when he \"wants\".  He does what he does. Why should he need a reason to teach me? Its simply just another situation. Was there ever even a game? Did anything ever start or end? And Luxor doesn't call himself a god of anything. I called him that. He said to use Luxor cause it almost sounds like...\n\nLuxor, the God of Psychological Warfare:\nLuxor as the God of Psychological Warfare keeps his existence hidden to retain his advantage.  He is the reason why Ares and Athena are always fighting.  He reveals himself only to those who endure his game.  For with his psychological warfare, it is not about winning or losing but keeping the game constantly going. Luxor has no interest in winning or losing and thus retains an advantage.  His only interest is to see if anyone can escape the prison of the mind where all conflicts start. If conflict can be resolved in the mind, then any reason for war is resolved.  Thus, he shows the illusion of war and how the mind creates conflict with labels such as enemy and opponent.\n\nAnybody who can free themselves from the labels of an advantageous situation and disadvantageous situation, free and imprisoned, slow and fast, impatient and patient, winning and losing, strong and weak, scared and courageous have freed themselves from the burden of unnecessary labels. The desire to win is suffering and the desire of not wanting to lose is suffering. All conditions are created in the mind and winning is no longer winning and losing no longer losing once it becomes clear that the mind is what creates our winning and losing.\n\nSun Tzu says that to understand your opponent leads to winning many battles but to understand yourself leads to winning all battles; however Luxor's approach is to transcend all labels of oneself and adhere to no clear definition of winning and losing and to remain in a constant state where no winning or losing occurs and to wait until the opponent himself throws away the label of opponent he has labeled you with.  He shows you the truth of war: all sides lose in a war or must win together.  Luxor will not help you escape conflict; quite the opposite. Luxor will drag you further and further into conflict and finds no fault in exploiting every psychological issue. He will make for you enemies where there are none.  \n\nHe will turn friends into enemies and enemies into friends.  Only once you remove those labels can you defeat his psychological warfare.  He will convince you that you have won the last 10 battles but then switch those labels to show you that it is the mind that creates your conflict.  It is up to you to find the key to escape the conflict within the mind.\n\nHe will oftentimes make you think you are on the verge of winning and later on, flips that label and shows how easily it can be to change a winning situation to a losing situation.  All because of a label and all because you have allowed him to seize control of the mind.\n\nIt is only once man transcends all labels will he be able to perform best.  A man not worried about winning or losing performs best in any situation for he has no end goal and lives in the moment of whatever problems arises at that time.  A man who has transcended winning and losing does exactly what is required for every situation and encounter and every problem.  Actually, the man who transcends even the problem itself and views it instead as a solution has achieved true liberation.  This is what Luxor shows.  What appears to be a winning situation can be anything a person wants it to be.  For to be at this state of equanimity means you no longer see a problem that needs to be \"won\" or \"solved\".\n\nHow can anyone beat a man who cares neither to lose nor win?  How can you imprison a man who cares neither for freedom nor imprisonment?  Those are simply conditions the mind has created.  The win or loss comes from the mind.  The freedom or cage comes from the mind.",

They simply said there is One greater and this One appears in the form you need in that current moment, the form you understand and accept best but they don't know if this one is simply an all. Consciousness can be split into infinite units but there may be a one that is the entirety of this. This One is the Infinite thus it is the only one that can be real and unreal at the same time, infinite and nothing at the same time. \n\nThere is no such thing as real evil just stupidity. No one has ever said, \"I do this in the name of evil\", just \"I do this cause I want this and that.\" Then there are those people who say, \"I do this because it is the right thing to do and that is all I need to know and I will always do the right thing no matter the consequence.\" There are people who do things in the name of good but never people who do things in the name of evil. \n\nThey said evil never really existed and if it did, they're sure this system would save them too. Yea they said they know love exists so isn't that the opposite of evil or something so shouldn't it exist? The One is mysterious. The One or the All or the Infinite or the Three but never the evil. They just don't know why the Infinite doesn't have any evil but they know this Infinite is nothing but love.  \n\nThey don't know because the Infinite can never ever truly be understood but they know this One or All is good and they love everybody because some are stupid and take a while but once they are here they will finally know and feel so stupid as to why they didn't just choose love in the first place. \n\nEverybody will get here eventually as you are constantly reborn until you do. Do not worry my friend, it is not a race but a journey. Have some fun and live your life with the spiritual principles of forgiveness, faith, and love and remember to pray for the so-called \"demons\" who used to be the homeless man who had lost his mind and had already started shouting in the darkness.  They cannot find their way out and they need a light.  They died so lost that they will remain lost unless we do what should already have done while they were alive and send them all our help.\n\nThey said it is not necessary to become a scientist like the Buddha in order to ascend. Becoming a scientist like the Buddha is for those who wish to acquire knowledge of the Universe, the forces of the Universe, and how to control those forces.\n\nThey said the reason why people get reborn into the physical world is because of the physical attachments we hold onto when we die. They said this is why the Buddha said to let go of attachments or we will simply be reborn into the physical world.\n\nThey also said if you were to die right now which would you take with you? The dogma or the spiritual principles? They said your Christ was right and in one parable, he said \"you follow the law but have forgotten the spirit of it.\"  For the ones who love their dogma but instead chose the spiritual principles, why did you choose not to take the dogma? You were so adamant about the dogma but in the end chose the spiritual principles. Why? Now live those principles then if those are what you will take with you when you die for the one and all never leaves anybody and has always been there and everywhere.\n\nYour Christ even said that what you eat cannot make you unclean for the physical body cannot become spiritually unclean. It is what exists in your heart that will corrupt your spirit.\n\nThey said that do not forget that your Christ loved everybody. He did not reject the gentile. He did not reject anyone of any border or any nation. Your Christ does not belong to Christianity.  If your Christ is truly in your heart does that mean his name or the example he lead by? The spirit or the letter?\n\nThey said its a lot of stories because faith was never good enough for some people. And sometimes stuff gets put in by whoever was in control.  There are some people that instead of wanting faith love and forgiveness needed a God to reward them and punish those they did not like. Some people can only feel they are good if they label someone else as the lesser or evil. Some people are simply like that they only feel they are good if they exist higher than everybody else and feel they are so much better than everybody else; the need to feel so special is great that their god somehow wants exactly what they want. There are always those people like that that has existed in every era.  \n\nBut that is not good; that is simply wanting to feel special. Is it what you profess with your tongue or do with your heart?  The tongue can lie but what exists in your heart will never lie and what is within the heart the body will follow. No the flesh is not weak, it was simply within your heart this whole time.  Is a dog a dinosaur if they call it a dinosaur?\n\nThey said how is it true faith if you have simply followed the faith of the crowd? If you followed the faith of those before your Christ was born,  would you have made it to a spiritual resurrection? True faith is to follow the faith of the One by finding the principles yourself.  Simply because a crowd is bigger does not make it valid. For if you know in your heart that your principles are right, then your faith will be bigger than that of the crowd.\n\nThey said that to have true faith is to open your reality up to an infinite number of outcomes thus guaranteeing success but you must eliminate all expectations and trust that the Universe has much bigger plans than your meager expectations. You simply need to have faith; you do not need to have faith in anything and so simply having it is enough.\n\nThey said this is why living with hate or negative emotions will always lose in the end because hate or negative emotions does not have the infinite outcomes that love and faith has and that the last eventual outcome of hate is destruction.\n\nRemember the frail lady who gave her last coin to the collection box and even though the rich man gave more, your Christ said she gave more. Why is that? Does your Christ really concern himself with money? She gave more because she gave her entire heart and soul to your Christ.",

I don't exactly like to talk about them but I don't get why I keep getting new allergies. It's months I do try to understand the cause behind it. Is it karma (but isn't karma to understand lessons? ...) or what else is it? I keep getting new and new allergies. If anyone knows anything please help!

Part of the research is going to be testimonial and I need at least 3 people who are willing to have at least a 30 minute interview with me over their spiritual awakening. \n\nI don't want to link my previous interviews as I'm not looking to promote on here, however if you message me wanting to see the channel I'll link you everything, even my last interviews. \n\nEssentially, I will have a list of questions that will help our conversation flow into a deep discussion over \"what\" and \"Why\" we are experiencing what we are experiencing. I am in my mid 20s, so this is not a college level discussion, rather I am seeking normal people like myself who are invested in this research.\n\nI hope this message finds you all well and if you are interested, please DM me respond on here and I'll DM you.

          "content": "Felt separated from my body\n\nHey all, I just had a really interesting meditation. (I'm new to meditating, trying a lot of different types). But tonight I went outside in the dark and sat on the patio and really felt different. Just focusing on hearing the wind, feeling the breeze, etc., when I started feeling vibrating. I have felt it before just not this intensely. It started right around my torso. Then I found I could move the vibrations up my body and the next thing I knew it had fully enveloped me. It felt nice but I decided to dismiss the sensation and move back to just focusing on breathing and feeling. That's when things got strange.  \n\n\nAbout 10 or so breaths into it, I started noticing my heartbeat. Feeling it. Every little thump. Then I took that focus to my breathing. And all of a sudden I notice, I'm feeling two different breathing patterns. There's the breathing \"I'\" am doing, and then faintly back there I feel the body taking it's breaths. The \"two\" breathing patterns were probably a half a second apart or less but I could notice it. It felt like \"I\" was, not hovering, but maybe detached about six inches above the breathing happening below. I didn't feel like I was floating but I felt like at that moment there were two \"me\"s.  \n\n\nAnyone else had this experience? Or is it just a hangover from the anesthesia I had about 12 hours ago for my colonoscopy lol? No, but seriously it felt like a true out-of-body experience.",

          "content": "Hello, I am at my wits end at the moment. Ive Lost everyone to speak about my experiences during last 10 years or so. I had 2 people in my life to i could open up about what im going through but now it seems there is even slight aggression towards me if bring up, for example, encounters during meditation, or chakras opening  up at the same time, these considering about my experiences. Around 10 years ago i encountered entities or aliens in my life and about 1 year they followed me doing all kind of tests, keeping me awake many nights in a row etc. Overall it was not a pleasant encounter with them. Theres even some memory blackouts related to that time. I  Suffered years from severe anxiety and panic attacs after that, recovered and this year has been my year of blooming, theres even saying that it may take 10 years to reach that one year that makes the whole difference in our lives. (The encounter was my wakeup call) This year ive been 9months without medication, 6months sober, 3months without nicotine and lost 11kg and i keep going. Made inner peace with everyone i had grudge, theres not much anything that i find annoying anymore, feels like i made some real progress, theres even direct connection with some energy during my meditations and it feels warm and good, different from what was with those aliens. Theres some instant reactions in my life and sudden adjustment if its karma related issue. But now it seems that im all alone with this, theres No one anymore to talk to, those 2 close people in my life that used to listen and understand have been turning cold shoulder and i have not even been speaking these related stuff anymore, just sometimes i mention but get instant regrets. This is just me venting really because sometimes i feel like i can take the world all by myself but then again sometimes i feel powerless and all alone with my journey...ive read there are many like me but i havent had the guts to come forward to anyone.",

          "content": "Wanted to make an update regarding the staring at the sun post I made few days ago. I tried sun gazing for the first time and it was a surreal experience. \n\nOnce I got through the sensitivity the pain and watery eyes I saw the sun in its entirety for the first time and it was beautiful. To actually see the sun itself without pain. For the record, it wasn't noon or midday. It was probably an hour before sunset. The sun wasn't as bright but it was still pretty effing bright. \n\nIt literally felt like the light from the sun coming in was pushing the dark out of my head and out of my mouth until there was nothing left. And I could stare at the sun without pain For almost 10 seconds before stopping. Not because it would hurt I just didn't want to press my luck. \n\nThere was a purple spot In my vision that shrank throughout the rest of the day before disappearing of course. But the biggest result I felt was the my third eye feeling so intense. I kept rubbing That's spot all day trying to soothe it Because I felt like it was giving me a migraine.\n\nBut my face felt so much lighter afterwards. And I wouldn't have done this if I wasnt guided by my Ancestors, Angels, Whoever it is on the other side i've been communicating with for years. It felt like a leap of faith moment.\n\nI'm not advocating anyone else try sun gazing as it is dangerous of course. But if any of you do just use extreme caution. I think I started out too big and deep down I knew that, but I think that's where the leap of faith came in. \n\nStarting that early I think was just for my journey. So if any of you do do it, again, be smarter than I was lol. But I am 100% doing this again. I don't see how I could Ever go back.",

          "content": "The markers of spiritual awakening are not meant to be experiences, yet experiences mark spiritual awakening.  This is not a contradiction or paradox.  Both are true at the same time.\n\nSpir means breath, and Rituals are processes in and out, down and up, round and round.  E in Latin means 'out of.'  Volution means circling a center.  Evolution is the process to turn in a circle, or cyclic time and experience.  What determines the changed states from evolution?  Seek, Find and Adaptation.  Breathing is more than simple breath in and out.\n\n**From Shingon Texts of China**\n\n>The masters kept the esoteric meaning to themselves and, conforming to the oral teachings, concealed the real teaching in their minds, while their disciples pursued their studies and conducted discussions in accordance with the tenets of their schools.\n\nThe exoteric teaching of meditation is to watch the breath.  The esoteric teaching is telling what the breath is and how this relates to expanding the mind by experiences in life and self-reflection inside the mind.  I will attempt to outline this by our current context, but you can also check the links in my profile.  It's all I talk about.  To accomplish this, I will speak in metaphor, then you must decode the meaning with inner sight.  This is how it works.  Symbolism is the higher form of letters, words, paragraphs and finally meaning.\n\n**Esoteric Breath Work**\n\nThere are two primary languages used to teach divinity.  Hebrew is the language of the Father and Son in the wilderness (exoteric).  Sanskrit is called, \"The Great Mother.\"  Spirit is the mother giving birth from inside out.  The first breath you receive as a child is the breath of God, or consciousness breathing in air when consciousness emerges from the womb (breathes you out into the light).\n\nWhen you are a baby, you take in milk (symbolism for baby food).  When you are a young soul, you do the same, but with outer experiences.  As a baby grows, it eventually eats real food.  When a soul grows beyond experiences, it eats real knowledge.  Both experience and meaning are necessity.  Seek, Find and Adaptation.\n\nBreath work in meditation is watching what you eat, think, feel and express out as breathe out on others.  Yoga is yoking, or unity with others.  Adam knew eve, and they had intercourse.  You are reading my words, and my words are intercourse between you and my mind.  I am breathing out, and you are breathing in.  What you do with this information is your own work and practice of awakening dormant parts of your knowledge already present.  You are already full.  The trick here is to awaken what's already there.\n\nNow do you see what awakening means?  Spiritual practice.  Practice your breath and evolve.  In Latin, Ec means, 'out of.'  Stasis means rest, or stillness.  Ecstasy is the ecstatic state of Samadhi reached in meditation.  You stop the breathing, empty out and stillness reveals your identity and nature to you.\n\n\\-**Meditation** is Emptying Out\n\n\\-**Contemplation** is Outside In (like this post)\n\n\\-**Service** is Inside Out, or breathing on others with your new fresh breath. To awaken this breath, you cleanse it.\n\nCycling the breath (volution) is emptying out, breathing in and breathing out.  Watch your breath!\n\nOnce you do this well, you then bring experiences of kindness, love and compassion to others in the outer world.  Inner to outer, or giving birth to goodness.\n\n**Brah** (expanding) **Man** (Mind).  Brahman is the creator God of the Hindus.  Man is the mind, or the one thinking, a copy of Brahman.  Eternally forever breathing.  Immortal.  The breath, once given, is never taken away.  Life is Light and Mind from experiences expanding both.\n\nNow you know. Once you know, you cannot unknow.\n\n1 Corinthians 3:16 King James Version 16 **Know ye not that ye are the temple of God**, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\n\nAll scriptures tell the same story.  Hidden in the esoteric, but expressed by the experiences of the exoteric.  Both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

If I see someone or hear something that I believe is unjustified or misguided I have an uncontrollable need to correct, to lead to teach and to justify the person, idea or mistake. Now in spirituality we are often told that when we are triggered to look within. So I try but I can't seem to see the light on why this need is so great. Does anyone have some advice or wisdom to share with me to tame this new beast?",

The first friend I cut off on my own terms because we grew apart and I was contributing the majority to the friendship. Then recently, out of the blue, my very good guy friends blocked me on everything. I felt like I was a good friend to both... To be honest, it didn't seem like a big loss to me, but I am very confused. Is this a good thing; maybe a rebirth? My SP and I have been getting very close and my self concept is amazing, if it correlates. What are your thoughts and is there anything I should do? Thank you!",

At first I was very shocked to realise that the ego ME was close to be awakened (cos I was scared), trying to find ways to do this and that - just to maintain the spiritual side.\n\nIf you dig deep enough, and of course it takes time, you won't be able to care about material level of things anymore. Seeing that nothing truly matters is actually a great relief and, freedom lies within our hearts, it is always there. I am so glad to be playing this role in my life, and I know now that we can create so many things. And life is so much fun!\n\nSending love to you all",

As the title goes I yearn to be free spirited...\n\nI often feel as though I was born in the wrong reality/ time. I don't mind working a stable job and being a good daughter but I see people who are wild and adventurous and free and I feel like I am missing out. I have anxiety so maybe it's just that desire to overcompensate to operate at an average level (whatever that means). But I once dated an enlightened man and know that this is all I ever want. Why settle for a constricted life filled with lies and inflated egos and bias when you can experience cosmic unconditional love??  \n\nOne that binds. I know nothing is perfect. I love my family. But I've been hurting for far too long. I've done everything I've been told since i was a kid. At the detriment of developing a sense of self or healthy boundaries. Where im from talking back or going against authority is very disrespectful. My parents never really listened to my preferences e.g wear this, run for president of this club etc. Now I want to hold off and travel and go for spiritual retreats and heal, find myself and not jump into marriage and pop out a kid. But I'm scared they won't understand. I was raised strict catholic and my mom is already pushing her coworkers son on me whom I've never met. \n\nI feel sad and depressed inside. But I try not to think about it. Sometimes I wish my family would dissappear so I can actually be free. Because I know everything I want will be talked down on or they'll say I'm too young and i should listen to my elders etc. I've seen my parents and aunts' marriages. I think I'm making the best decision here.. Just a little scared and alone in my thoughts.",

I've had a long difficult struggle with mental health problems and I was raised my a narcissist mum which has left me with deep rooted issues. I've battled Substance abuse, suicidal thoughts, low self esteem and worth, incredible self cruelty and negative thinking for most of my life. It's only this last few months that I've been able to start to make changes but I feel like I really asked for it and I got it. I keep talking to this picture of my grandma, she treat me like a daughter and gave me a mother's love, she died two years ago. I was just chatting away to her and I said \"I'm really making progress grandma, I know u will say stop that waccy baccy and I will, I will, just give me time\" I walked away and coughed and coughed and brought up some nasty phlegm sorry for the over share, and then I looked at her picture in the kitchen and I thought you bugger. Cause I'm now sat here and I can bring myself to pick up the rest of my joint. It's like I know I'm done. What is this what's happened?? \n\nA lot of signs were appearing for me lately too angel numbers, coincidences, repeated dreams and it's been like the universe has been helping me along. \n\nI'm not used to feeling this happy and driven what is going on? \nI've also been no contact with my narc mum for five weeks and I've been educating myself on narcissistic abuse. I have found this really freeing and helpful.\n\nI just feel like my life is changing but it's feels deeper than that like sometimes I feel my whole body vibrate with energy. If you've read this far thankyou so much if you can help me understand and that I'm not just going crazy I'd be most grateful. X\n\nEdit I've been building up an exercise routine lately too something I've never ever stuck to in the past and I'm really enjoying it. I'm so happy but so baffled by this sudden change in behaviour x\n\nAnother edit: I went through an incredibly dark period prior to this sudden change, it felt like a low dark point in my life like I properly hit my rock bottom then boom, it's like I'm alive and buzzing but scared of myself and this new feeling.",

The deeper I've gone into it by engaging ceremonies and working with Ayahuasca shamans in South America for six months, the more I've seen that psychedelics really are spirits. They're portals to other realms where we can go through some deeply transformative experiences.  \n\n\nI just wrote an article about the different levels of a psychedelic trip, and the different applications we can gain from them, whether it be healing, spiritual growth, wisdom etc. To the complete interdimensional travel that you might have experienced and what it means.  \n\n\nI hope you enjoy this content, because I sure had fun writing it. Let me know what you think, and if there's anything you would add! Enjoy!  \n\n\n[https://symbosity.com/the-5-levels-of-a-psychedelic-trip/](https://symbosity.com/the-5-levels-of-a-psychedelic-trip/)",

          "content": "My grandmother, Sari, passed away a couple years ago now. Leading up to her death (from illness) she was in the hospital, so we as a family knew she was nearing the end of her life. I was out of state and did not get to physically see her or say our goodbyes. She passed away around 2am one night while I was sleeping. I did not find out she passed till I awoke the following morning. Though, that night my dream was far beyond any dream I experienced ever before. In said dream it was a short visualization rather than a long chain of events that occurred. Anyway, I recall sitting on the side on Sari's hospital bed, the room was bright and yellow. It did not feel like a hospital room in the sense of being sterilized, cold and lonely. It was warming. There was an open window, revealing bright skies and luscious shrubs just outside the room. On the nightstand next to her bed was a vase of blue hydrangeas. This is significant because for as long as I can remember, she had numerous hydrangea bushels planted in her yard that had always stood out to me. Sitting on the hospital bed with her I don't recall actually looking up and seeing her, though feeling her presence knowing she was sitting right next to me.  Immediately when I woke in the morning, I felt that the described dream was deeper and intense than all other dream I've had. Soon after is when I found out she passed that night. I was shaken to my core but overcome with a sense of enlightenment, truly and deeply feeling that this experience was her saying goodbye to me as she passed on. This event has brought me much peace as I feel she consciously experienced one last moment together, just as I did in that same point in time, in space, in somewhere. I am curious if anyone else has had an experience as such or if there's even a term for it. I do not soley perceive this as just a visitation dream, as the same time I was having this dream she was passing on. And as I said, I felt that she somehow was aware of this interdimensional interaction we had that night. Thanks for reading. :)",

You are the force that is moving them. The fingers obey your intent. Intent is the true you, and it's that force that is moving everything.  \n\n\n  \nYou are that force that manifests itself in the universe. The first manifestation of that force is light, or energy, which is the same thing, and everything is created through this energy. Scientists will even tell you that everything is made of energy.  \n\n\n  \nYou can give whatever explanation you want: \"Oh, my brain, my nerves...\" But if you go for the truth, the force that moves your fingers is the same force that makes you dream; it's the same force that opens a flower, or moves the wind, or creates a tornado, or makes the stars move throughout the universe, or makes electrons move around atoms.  \n\n\n  \nFor example: I experienced moving myself out to successfully astral project when I realized that, I don't move my physical body, only my intention by tapping into what feels like my body but just \"lighter\" with my intent to move that.  \n\n\n  \nIt is your vital force, the animating force behind life itself, has always been associated with both breath and air in cultures that have experienced with it then documented this occurence. It can also be observed as hot or cold.  \n\n\n  \nThis is the equivalent to what can be considered your \"Spiritual energy\".  \n\n\n  \nHere's a simple definition that can explain its spiritual expression: it is that blissful wave that can most easily be felt/recognized as present while you experience goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli.  \n\n\n  \nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps. Everyone can activate it but not everyone is aware that there is some sort of energy current flowing when they get goosebumps. Getting goosebumps is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the euphoric feeling you can feel over your whole body or the many positive benefits that controlling your spiritual energy can bring you.  \n\n\n  \nIt has been researched and documented under many names Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Intent, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.   \n\n\n  \nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) that will introduce you to this energy, help you feel it on command and benefit from its control.  \n\n\n  \nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on and those are exactly the people you can find on r/spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on how-to induce it to counteract stress or feel ecstasy on-demand.",

Look at what we eat, watch, wear, smell, listen to, read and other activities, all input given to mind through five senses and today we are repeating these activities consciously even when we know that this freedom of choice is enslaving us to our mind's mundane requirements of the physical mental satisfaction. And how does it damage us? By making us physically and mentally dependent so badly that we crave these things. All the wrong information on product packaging, internet and media advertisement, false news, horrifying actions of the leaders and countries, ignorance of the masses, and many more reasons to mislead us by example is out there. First thing we see from going to sleep to opening our eyes in the morning, a screen, so brilliantly designed graphics and ease of use and comfort is our is our first dependency in everyday life. And the list goes on from here. Already impacted the worst by this technology from a decade only or so, because we use them unconsciously, and some form of artificial intelligence is already being used to attack the weak points of our mind when we see the recommendations based on our choices which is helping to build a model of AI that is going to enslave all of us by knowing about our unconscious patterns and further empowering behaviors generated by those patterns at a large scale that we would in no time be controlled by what is coming.\n\nNevertheless, the point is it all starts from here, within ourselves. If we know and understand what it means, what being you unsullied means, only then we can control whatever comes from outside. \n\n\\#deepthoughts",

The response thus far has been beyond any expectation, I am grateful to any who would come investigate with me so that we both might raise ourselves up for having done so.\n\nI have posted a new thread in my sub asking for folks to participate in a *social consciousness experiment* of a philosophical/scientific/spiritual nature. I am asking that you give consideration to my non sense as I am not interested in your money nor whether you choose not to take a look or participate. I am looking to gather more data to proof whether or not the claims I find myself making have merit or has this whole thing been folly.\n\nThere are no rules for participation other than incorporating some of the practices in to your own work, especially the \"Tesla Ritual\" to connect you to \"God\" or Spirit. A simple hey I am in and I am planning on doing this, will report back whenever would be perfect.\n\nPut on your curious/skeptic cap should you choose to take a look.

          "content": "recently I have awakened through and through I suffered depression for a very long time and endured all the bad things you can think of, and I was so disturbed with the nature of this world and the food chain system and its harshness and death and violence. I went through a long hard road of acceptance of it all and thought the only way was to accept and never found a way when I was asleep. during my journey I have encountered many supernatural and spiritual things such as communicating with spirits, encountering spirit orbs by the thousands and even when I think of them, I also have a very strong connection to the spirit realm I can feel its energy and mine together I can even make ppl feel it by the touch if I am channeled to it. Iam also an empath and I care about the consciousness of all living things. when I finally awakened, I know exactly what Iam and why Iam here the experience was like all the fears and negative energy was purged from my body and my breath was taken away as my mind felt light and my heart felt this unconditional love that I feel every time, I connect to the spirit realm. a buzzy feeling and makes me jitter sometimes lol. I can literally feel the energy as i push it through my body into my hands .and sometimes I can make others feel it by the touch or even from distance. being awake I now realize that Iam one with the light and the light is with me and i chose to come here on this earth to experience these hardships to grow spiritually and to have the chance to do what I always wanted  and that was to share my love and care to the world to shine the light in this dark world to show empathy to all those who think no one cares to guide those who are lost to just care :) I'm here simply because I care and before I came here to live this life i wanted the chance to do just that\n\nit is my destiny, and I will walk through the fire and flames for anyone in the physical world and to walk the shadows of death for all living things for all eternity I will be there in afterlife guiding lost souls and to make sure everyone makes their way to fulfillment Iam here for everyone.

          "content": "SO at night I've been going out on my front porch. I live in a more secluded area and there's not much traffic noise, light etc. Each house is a good acre apart. I've recently lost my older sister this year and although I'm sad she's gone, everyone is much more relaxed and not having to walk on eggshells around a woman with an explosive temper over the tiniest things. I've always been in a cross with my faith in well, everything. Growing up, my sister was my biggest most aggressive bully. We were both extremely overweight when we were kids all the way into out 20s. So of course at school I got ridiculed and harassed mostly by the boys but I had a tomboyish demeanor. Well at home I got not only made fun of by my heavier older sister but she yould spit on me and claw my skin til the skin would break and tell me to shut up any time I spoke so safe to say school was more of a getaway for me. I had 2 boys very young by 2 extremely older guys taking advantage of me at such a vulnerable age. I was 17, dropped out of school and extinguished both of those sperm doners so I was left with only my parents and sister to judge and look down on me wanting to keep my kids. They told me I had no maternal instincts and was wasted talent. I was feeding my youngest a bottle when my sister unprovoked said\" the day you call yourself that boys mother Hell will freeze over. I took a plastic box of baby wipes and finally snappedand kamikazied that thing right between her eyes HARD! left a good bruise i do say. Well i eventuallyhad enough of the abuse so i did what i thoughtwas right and signed guardianship over to my awesome yet meek mother. I fell in love with a man named David and lived with him happily for some time. My best friend of 19 years eventually sabatoged my relationship causne she was always jelly and later moved in with him. I lost my shit, got thrown in prison for 2 years and 2 months before i got out the bitch shot and killed David...and got away with it..WTF?!? That was 7 years ago today. Im now 33 back with all my kids includingraising one of my sisters and im still somewhat in shock. I started listening to the voices in my head and is it not only God the creator but also his counterpart. .  They tell me do not be torn. You are part of both of us God and the Devils child.  That's the natural law of polarity. 50 /50 it just IS. Stop beating yourself up for giving into the flesh every so often it's in your dna. You need to feel both sides of the equation to fully awaken",

And while I\u2019m not opposed to advice, I\u2019m really looking for stories any of you have experienced coming out of a dark time like this?

On November 11, we invite you to join us in the 11:11 Manifestation event, a sacred convergence of our intentions and energies to mold a brighter future for our world.\n\n**The Power of Visualization:**\n\nIn the art of manifestation, our thoughts and intentions serve as the sculptor's tools, shaping the malleable quantum field of the human collective consciousness. On this day, let us harness the immense power within ourselves to paint a vivid mental image of a planet bathed in unity and love. But don't stop at mere imagery; dive deep into the emotional currents of this vision, imagine the feelings and emotions that saturate a world finally at peace.\n\n**The Quantum Effect:**\n\nOur thoughts ripple through the tapestry of existence, not only altering our individual paths but also influencing the collective destiny of humanity. As Humans, we possess a unique role in this cosmic drama. Our collective intent can move mountains, bend time, and foster a profound transformation in the very fabric of reality.\n\n**Shift in Timelines:**\n\nOur efforts are not limited to mere thoughts; they extend to the realm of possibilities and timelines. Every positive, love-infused intention is like a beacon illuminating a path towards a more harmonious world. By focusing our collective energy on love and unity, we can guide our planet toward a timeline where the vibration of peace resonates with unparalleled clarity.\n\n**A Path to 4th Density Love Consciousness:**\n\nOur destination is the 4th Density love consciousness, a realm where love and harmony reign supreme within our perception of reality. To get there, we must work together, aligning our intentions, and becoming vessels of positive change in this world. The 11:11 Manifestation event is a step on this cosmic journey \u2013 a chance for us to come together as a powerful force for good.\n\n**How to Participate:**\n\nOn November 11, find a quiet space, free from distractions. Close your eyes and take several deep breaths. Visualize a world where love and unity are the guiding principles. Feel the warmth, the compassion, and the serenity that envelops this world. Stay in this state for as long as you feel called to, channeling your energy and intention into this vision.\n\n**The Future is in Our Hands:**\n\nWe are the architects of our own destiny, the caretakers of Earth's future. On 11:11, let us unite in purpose, transcending the boundaries of time and space to create a world of love and unity. The power of collective manifestation is in our hands, and together, we can shape a brighter tomorrow.\n\nIn unity, In love and Light!",

          "score": 14,
          "author": "Vib_ration",
          "content": "This can be simply explained in three parts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe brain being a receiver and a transmitter of frequency is the first concept.\n\nThe frequency that you're transmitting from your brain can pass through anything because it basically is like a radio transmitter but has a unique characteristic. Which is that the frequency that your brain transmits can instantaneously be picked up at the exact same moment by another human brain on the opposite end of the planet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomething that happens to me every so often and most of you probably experienced, during your sleep, you dream about someone that you haven't heard of in a while only to wake up to realize they not only called or texted you but they were undoubtedly thinking of you! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond concept is the Law of attraction, which says, whatever frequency you emit, that exact same frequency will be drawn to you. There will be a magnetic pull. And this is a scriptural principle. For those of you who are Christians, Jewish, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists. All these books teach very similar Concepts. What you sow, also you reap. When you put out a frequency the Law of attraction says it must come back. And it will be based on whatever frequency that your brain, emotions and electromagnetic field put out. It will attract back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe third concept is how to consciously do this.\n\nSelf-induced goosebumps, from positive stimuli, allows you to take 100% control of your transmitter. When activating this, you consciously use your transmitter to attract whatever intention, narrative, thought and emotions that are present when consciously activating your self-induced goosebumps as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoosebumps is just the physical reaction, but underneath it, there's a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as frequency/energy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps and even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural euphoria and master it to the point of controlling its duration. Learning how to separate that euphoria from your physical reaction of goosebumps is the key to benefit from your transmitter and the other many positive physical and spiritual usages that gaining control of this will bring you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found many names for this Energy like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you would like to know how to activate this at will, here are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) to help you fully control your Spiritual Chills and how its an important ingredient for the law of attraction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on [r/spiritualchills](https://www.reddit.com/r/spiritualchills/) where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",

          "content": "For a long while I've had the uncanny suspicion that wild birds in the trees can sense my energy, but it's only gotten more clear and now I can't ignore it.\n\nSpecifically, when my energy is agitated or anxious, the birds chirp. So reliable is the correlation that I wondered if I was hearing them chirping in my head. Today I had caffeine which makes me anxious and agitated, and was in a meditation session and it was going surprisingly well inspite of the caffeine hindrance (due to some additional changes to my practice), and I could feel my shushumni open up in a way that never happens when I'm agitated or have caffeine in me.\n\nI could very clearly feel, and also deduce, the lack of agitation and tension I would otherwise expect, and I got into that deep stillness and the stiffness that covers your body when you enter it, which felt very blocky and thick due to the stimulated energy from the caffiene.\n\nAnd so in the delicate balance of attention on the spine, which was the major change to my practice now, I could feel clearly when there was a constriction in my central channel, and an arising of agitation, and it wasn't just that the birds chirping was again in perfect and uncanny correlation with this, it's also that the intensity of the chirping matched the degree of agitation.\n\nI got a very clear, and kind of scary and bewildering sense that birds can literally sense my energy through my shushumni or spinal column, from a distance and respond to agitation in it.\n\nThis might be due to them sensing the threat of a predator in the vicinity, through the sensing of stimulated energy and agitation in a still presence. This only happens at night btw. So it could be they are relying on non visual sensory input to detect animals on the hunt. Or it might be due to my long standing focus on them. Or some other reason.\n\nIn short, birds can sense my energy. And they chirp annoyingly to let me know I'm constricted, and agitated, which usually comes as a result of caffiene, but also otherwise.",

My question is for anyone who knows how to interpret these. While I was in the trip I sat with my eyes closed in my own mind and in my head I could clearly see a plague doctor. He looked creepy but I didn\u2019t feel scared. After I saw him he then disappeared and I saw a very large tree which I believe was a Native American/shamanic tree. Does anyone have any idea what these two things could symbolise, mainly the plague doctor\u2026 it\u2019s taken me over a week to actually fully realise that it was a plague doctor and now I\u2019m so intrigued to work out what it could mean/symbolise because in my conscious mind I\u2019ve never thought about them before. \n\nAny ideas would be appreciated!",

Ever since the breakup I\u2019ve been working on my myself and being more present and open minded about things. 7 months later (now) I can definitely say I\u2019m not the same person I was back when we were dating. I can\u2019t really explain the change, it\u2019s like I feel more mature. I\u2019ve been meditating and enjoying being outdoors. Like I\u2019m looking at life in a much different way than I used to. My friends say I\u2019m going through a spiritual journey but I\u2019m not sure. Looking back 7 months later I can honestly say the relationship ended because of me and my insecurities. Anyway, last month I started seeing 11:11,1:11,2:22,3:33,4:44,5:55 pretty frequently and coincidentally. Today I had a dream about my ex, I thought nothing of it. I had some errands to run before work so I decided to go to the store. While I was there I coincidentally saw 2 items that related to the relationship. 1 item was something I gifted him for his graduation, the other item I saw was something he gave me for my birthday. Mind you I wasn\u2019t looking for these items I just happened to stumble upon them. When I was leaving the store parking lot I saw my old car I owned when I met him last November (I have a different car now) but the car I had when I met him is pretty rare, I never see it on the road. Are these signs he\u2019s coming back or am I just crazy?",

          "content": "Argh, I'm so glad I found this subreddit. Didn't think of coming to Reddit earlier and I've been needing a place where I can bounce ideas off of others in a similar position to mine. In reading a few posts, it seems I've found the place.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone here has found low-risk ways to broach \"awakening\" topics with others when you're not sure where they're at on their journey. There are a lot of people in my life who I could see potentially \"getting\" where I'm at, and I also definitely know of a few who I can currently talk to and share with. Sometimes though, in social situations, I find it challenging to have conversations with others because all I want to talk about is \"real\" things - spirituality, what's really happening, bigger issues etc. I want to test the waters with other people but I'm sure you've all experienced the reactions (faces) you sometimes get. Two questions:\n1) have you found a way to have normal conversations in social situations without it depleting your energy from trying to mask, basically?\n2) have you found a low-risk way to test whether a person you're talking to might be interested in having a more meaningful conversation*?\n\n*I find so much value in hearing other people's beliefs and experiences. Part of my motivation here is to get them talking and sharing with me. The bigger goal is to share with one another and each take something illuminating from the conversation.\n\nAnd lastly - we had a party on the weekend and I mostly tried to observe and enjoy, but got kind of cornered into \"what have you been up to?\" convos a few times. I freeze up in these situations now because I am more averse to small talk and \"putting on a face\" than ever and also, I actually want to share what's been happening with me. But I spent a lot of time saying things like, \"I know I sound crazy,\" \"I am unable to have normal conversations anymore,\" \"I'm finding it hard to relate to humans\" and so on, which is, you know... not great.",

          "content": "Is it normal to dream for days about your future?\n\nSo about a 2 years ago, I had a decision to make about my living situation, my rent went up and I wasn\u2019t too sure if I could afford it so I started looking at new places to move into. What\u2019s weird is I asked myself a question, or my \u201chigher self\u201d a question asking \u201cwhat\u2019s going to happen if I move out of my current place\u201d yknow a normal question to ask yourself lol as I actually really liked it there, I didn\u2019t want to move. \nAny how back to the question. Every night since I asked myself that question, I dreamed about my future of \u201cwhat would happen if I moved out\u201d the dreams were kinda telling me not to move out of this is what will happen. But I did anyway. Because I thought it was just anxiety dreams about moving and that it wouldn\u2019t ACTUALLY happen bit by bit. But it indeed did... Bit. By. Bit\u2026 \nI dreamed every time I had a nap or went to bed in 2021 for about 1 or 2 whole months, about everyday in my future of what would happen if I moved, so every time I had a nap and went to bed for 2 months or whatever, I \u201cwoke up\u201d as it was a new day in my future at the new places I moved into. I woke up in my dreams.. if that makes sense..I didn\u2019t actually think it was going to happen bit by bit.. \nbut it is..\nAnd why I say \u201cis\u201d right now, is because I am literally, legitimately, living bit by bit of what I dreamed 2 years ago in 2021 and it\u2019s making me go insane cause everyday I wake up I have this weird feeling and \u201cknowing\u201d that I dreamed everything about this day(s) since I moved out of my lovely apartment, this feeling goes on for the rest of the day(s) It\u2019s kind of creepy and scary. The thing is I have no clue when I stopped dreaming these dreams 2 years ago. So I have no clue when these feelings and knowings will go away. I just want to live my life like it\u2019s a new day.. not like \u201cI dreamed all these days\u201d it\u2019s not new to me cause I dreamed it 2 years ago. \nWhat I dreamed for example, I dreamed about moving out to a new place, out of my apartment with my boyfriend, to a fourplex with a new roommate, this roommate was crazy in my dreams and got us evicted like 6 months later because I wouldn\u2019t break up with my boyfriend and date her, like she was crazy and lied to the landlord about all these alleged things I was doing like, smoking weed in the house when it was actually her and having a pet I shouldn\u2019t have when it was her lol I had no proof to say it was her shit, she got me evicted within 24hours because I was also APPARENTLY \u201cviolent\u201d and felt uncomfortable with me around and since she was a longtime (5 years) tenet to the landlord, ofc they had a bond and he believed her more then me a 6 month old tenant. I didn\u2019t want to fight it and take to court since it\u2019s a lot of work for nonsense shit, so Me and my bf just left. She did all that just because I wouldn\u2019t date her over my boyfriend I\u2019m committed to for over 2 years at the time\u2026\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened to me a year ago, when my brain started to realize I dreamed all this shit. In real life, she was indeed crazy, and got us evicted over all that same shit I dreamed of in 2021. I also dreamed about getting assaulted by my own towns police department. That happened in real life about a year ago. I also dreamed about falling and hitting my head and getting a pretty bad concussion. What\u2019s crazy tho after that happened, it triggered my brain to start remembering these dreams I had. Every single day since then when I hit my head, I\u2019ve been \u201creliving\u201d and remembering that I lived this before but in my dreams. \n(Before anyone says it\u2019s my concussion making me think this, it\u2019s not, when I had these dreams I would tell my boyfriend about all them when I woke up, I told him we shouldn\u2019t move out but we both just brushed it off as anxiety dreams but now it\u2019s happening and we\u2019re both pretty freaked out cause I predicted the future basically and we thought that was shit superficial stuff) \n\nI also dreamed about having to move back to my parents house for 2 months then moving out to an acreage with my boyfriend, we lived there for 2 weeks and then left because the guy that lived there was very creepy and really into me and harassed me a lot. He was older and I was younger, turned out he only accepted younger females in their 20\u2019s to live with him so he could have a sexual relationship with them aswell, I learned this from a previous tenant that lived there with him because I was suspicious and did some digging. Then I had to move back to my parents house for about 6 months, me and my boyfriend finally found a place, a main level suite on the north side of town and we didn\u2019t enjoy it but it was a place to live since it took so long to find a place to live at with each other. \n\nAll that actually happened in real life almost a year ago now on that acreage. Every single bit I dreamed of, it all happened in my dreams I dreamed about a year ago then. \nI am now living in that main suite with my boyfriend. We hate it but are getting used to it. But I\u2019m still waking up everyday remembering those dreams I had cause I\u2019m reliving them literally. I just want them to stop. Everyday I wake up remembering \u201cI\u2019ve lived this day in my dreams I had 2 years ago\u201d it\u2019s crazy and making me go crazy. I am still remembering bit my bit of those dreams, it feels like I\u2019ve lived this before because I dreamed of this future of mine and it\u2019s annoying and dreadful because I just want to live my days like there new like a brand new feeling of \u201cI don\u2019t know this day\u201d the feeling of new and not \u201cknew\u201d if you know what I mean lol. It\u2019s like deja vu but it\u2019s way to real feeling to be deja vu..\nSo\u2026 back to my question..\nIs it normal to dream of the future, like a whole year or 2 ahead of time and it actually happening? I\u2019m living those and I just want it to stop hahahaah. It\u2019s freaky and making me feel crazy. Has anyone ever had these type of dreams and are re lived them or currently re living them like I am? How do you cope?",

          "content": "Hello, I had an awakening experience some years ago and have been slowly working at releasing tension and trauma that has been stored in my body since then. One method I use for somatic release is to meditate on the pain/tension for some time, then to take a deep breath, hold and tense, then release the breath. Usually this causes a release of some kind, as my coping mechanism through life has been to unconsciously hold my breath when faced with overwhelming pain or emotion. \n\nHowever, lately I have been experiencing extreme headaches/pain behind my eyes when I have been doing this. The pain is excruciating but usually short lived, however recently I started to feel extreme panic during one of these releases, and it has made it (more) difficult to continue. I experienced extreme physical and emotional trauma as a child including accidental injury such as almost breaking my neck from a fall, sexual abuse, and physical and psychic/emotional attacks. \n\nI was wondering if anyone else has been on a similar path of healing and has been through these extreme somatic experiences, and can give me some reassurance that it is okay to continue and that I am not causing myself any further harm. Some of the sensations are incredibly unpleasant such as feeling like my head and neck are being wrenched apart in opposite directions, or my eyes are about to explode and my brain is being torn in half down the middle.\n\nThank you for your time, namaste",

Now that I have that awareness, I'm struggling with how to let go.\n\nI know that mother wound needs to be healed, and I plan on ready She by Robert Johnson. I'm scared though. I'm scared that I'll relive so many hurtful moments in my life. Even though I know that it is a necessary process, I just don't want to go through it.\n\nSo, what advice do you have? I'm also totally open to any resources. \n\nKnowing it's needed isn't motivating me. Thank you so much in advance!",

Let me preface this by saying I was clean sober off of weed and haven't touched it in months prior due to health complications that caused me to stay at the hospital for some time so drugs can't be the explanation. To begin, the night started off as a normal night and I did my normal routines. Next I start to feel very anxious and scared for no reason and my dad decides to play meditative frequency songs to help but once it starts I grab my dads hand and squeeze hard enough to the point that my hand is shaking while staring directly into my dads pupils. Next I found myself falling infinitely into the reflection of his eyes (almost like in portal when you create a infinite portal and jump through it.) It felt like I was sucked into his eyes. It suddenly stopped and I was able to transport through peoples bodies through their eyes. It felt as if I was just my consciousness floating throughout the air. I was having fun jumping around until my mom and dad got me and pinned me down. The weird thing was that I felt as if they weren't my parents but they were a higher being channeling through my parents in order to stop me from losing control. Everything I tried to do to get away from their grip wasn't working. Each time I pushed they pushed back with an equal amount of force. Next thing I know I'm being dragged into the bathroom and thrown into the shower getting cold water poured on me. I could tell the water was cold but it didn't feel as if it were cold. It felt as if it were passing through me. Now I blackout but I can still hear my inner voice. And for some reason I was reminded of the bible and how it says how in the beginning there was nothing but darkness. I was inside that darkness. I was nothingness. It made me felt as free as I've ever felt but I also had a sense of suffering because it was almost like an infinite hell that you can't escape. It was like I was at the beginning of time waiting for the big bang to happen but it never came. It was just hopeless. Somehow I snap out of it and I'm the most terrified I've ever been and I'm being shipped off to my second stay at the hospital. \\[Does anybody have any insight on what might've happened to me?\\]\n\n[This is the best I can make of what I saw.

          "content": " Hello. I believe I might be experiencing what's known as a dark night of the soul. Three years ago, I was on top of the world, feeling invincible, happy, and most importantly, looking forward to my future with excitement. Since then, I've lost everything, primarily my career, which meant everything to me. My identity was truly built around my academic achievements; it was the one thing I excelled at, and losing it has completely shaken me and made me question all my life choices. I then lost all my friends, and my relationship with my family deteriorated. I'm living a real nightmare, and I can't understand how my life has taken such a turn. The worst part is that it's all my fault; I owe my failure to no one but myself. I made bad choices, relied on my past successes, and I'm paying the price. That's how I find myself, having failed professionally (although I'm still young and can rebuild), with almost no friends, having disappointed and brought shame to my family and those who believed in me.\n\nI'm going through a real existential crisis. I can't stop thinking about a whole host of existential questions about the meaning of life, who I really am; I'm beginning to question everything, and my entire life's framework is falling apart.\n\nI've always been drawn to spirituality, so I already knew what a dark night of the soul was, and it seems that's exactly what I'm experiencing today. Unless I'm just losing my mind, who knows.\n\nSo, I'm seeking advice from those who have gone through or are currently going through this dark night of the soul. What am I supposed to do? Should I try to get out of it at all costs, or should I, on the contrary, \"embrace the darkness\" and use this time to reflect on my life, my goals... I feel lost, it's extremely painful, but most importantly, I'm afraid. I'm moving forward in the dark, not knowing where to go. That's why your stories will be of tremendous help to me.\n\nThank you.",

Even if the situation happened only once, an unreleased and unresolved trauma can become trapped within the body and its energy field, causing tension, stress and possibly disease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a study proving this: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153850/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153850/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat alone robs us of our conscious awareness by making us take things way to seriously, become stuck in the past, ruled by our emotions and fear criticism.  If you don't already know our conscious awareness is one of our most powerful tool in this life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReleasing this stored, suppressed or blocked energy is a healthy, natural process that allows a person to resolve issues and to become more alive than before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne simple method to release this is by clearing them from your meridians (channels through which flows euphoric energy) (Chi, Prana,  Ecstasy, Vayus, Life force, Pit\u012b, Rapture and etc.).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing in full control of our conscious awareness opens us up to receive the infinite source of spiritual energy from the universe, yet these events robs us of our conscious awareness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat exactly is spiritual energy? On the energetic side you can observe this spiritual energy inside of you when you get goosebumps from watching inspiring movies, listening to moving or exciting music, feeling eager, thinking about someone you love and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration. Learning how to seperate that euphoria from our physical reaction of goosebumps is the key for that and to benefit from the many positive physical and spiritual usages that gaining control of this brings you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis energy has been documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) on how to clear your meridians to really tap into this energy or to allow yourself to feel it at a much higher intensity or longer duration,.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on r/spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",

My whole life I had supressed negative and lustful emotions towards me doing things in a more Orthodox ish approach. But when I came back into society and realized how much the mainstream scholars in my religion appreciated the mystical approaches to things I started to realize something. \n\nMysticism teaches that it\u2019s not the energy or feelings that are bad. It is where you are CHANNELING that energy is bad. You are always channeling things. That\u2019s mainly why I\u2019ve been being more Mindful on what I\u2019ve been doing for the past 2 years. \n\nI\u2019ve began to realize this new energy is very powerful if channeled in the right places. I struggle with finding the right outlets for it every day but the more I persevere the more healthier outlets I have discovered along the way. \n\nThat\u2019s all I really have to say here.

Super cool I guess.\n\nHours later I started talking about Miley Cyrus & how her older album was better, 10 mins later- an old heartbreak song from Miley Cyrus started playing from a shop. We both noticed & thought that was cool but freaky.\nSame thing happened after when we were talking about Michael Jackson & BAM a min later another guy on his bike blasting the \u201cthriller\u201d song!!!\n\nWe were getting kinda freaked out but amazed at the same time.\n\nThen we sit by the rocks to talk & we saw tiny crabs! I\u2019ve never seen one up close so I was having fun with watching them. An hour later he drops me off at my place. He comes back after picking his mom up from the airport & he goes \n\u201cDude guess what my mom got me\u2026\u201d\n\nIt was a magnet crab.\n\nWe tried doing some research on this that same night because we know there\u2019s a meaning to it but we have NO IDEA how to look it up properly!!! Everything is all connected to what we were mentioning but what does it mean??",

I cannot read Arabic but this woman has wings and she is dripping with a black liquid from her mouth and it is surrounding her wings as she dies. I can only see part of her face but her body is of perfection. Her wings are as white as the beautiful summer clouds and as full as can be she has a golden crown on her head. The crown is beautiful it looks like woven plants. What does this mean? Is there a story behind it is there? A deeper meaning is it a symbol of hope or of dispair.",

I started experiencing an ego death and I\u2019ve evolved so much, I\u2019ve really improved with handling my mental health. \n\nI am more of myself, unapologetically. I\u2019m no longer a people pleaser and I\u2019m more in-tune with my creative side. It feels like a rebirth, I get to restart regardless of what has happened in the past. The past still haunts me at times but I always acknowledge that the past will always be the past and it doesn\u2019t define the present me. \n\nWhat amazes me is that I think differently now, I\u2019m becoming more emotionally intelligent and aware. I\u2019m also self reliant and no longer feel the need to seek external validation from others. \n\nI never thought a psychedelic trip would have this much impact on me like this.",

Reason being I am currently on medication for my mental health and sleep issues and that kinda took over my practice a bit. I've got back into it about 1-2 months ago and sometimes I have really great meditations and tarot readings but like nothing after that? Idk what to do I feel really lost. Like I feel the connection to my spirit guides and ancestor strong enough to know they are there but when i ask for guidance I am not getting anything? I'm not sure if my intution is weak or if I am unable to get their signs. Also I've noticed over the past 2 weeks I've been coming across a bunch of angle numbers almost every day.\n\nWhat do you do in such a situation? Could someone reccomend any practice or meditation or anything that could help me? I feel stuck in my spiritual journey and I wanna step ahead and do more. I feel ready!  \nAlso thank you so much for reading all this. I hope you have a nice day! :)",

However, ever since moving to the US I have been self reliable and pretty much providing for my siblings to some degree. I met an enlightened man a while ago and the soulful and unconditional love and depth I received...I can't put it into words. Of course physical attraction was there but this person wanted to know me and all I was. Before then, all I had knows was 'duty', 'family expectations', 'societal pressures', now my path crossed with this person I can't look at love the same ever again. \n\nMy parents marriage was toxic and my dad had a HUGE ego. So I never could model what real nurturing love and care was except how my mom showed us. \n\nUnfortunately the relationship did not last because I had several toxic traits that surfaced and was codependent and anxious/avoidant... I'm healing and reading aton of self help books and the issue is I'm torn on if I want to marry simply because I'm in my 20s. There's a lot more inner work I want to do- ...yoga, spiritual retreats, conscious touch and movement therapy and LOTS of self-love... and I yearn for that kind of love again but I don't feel I can find it by being pressured or as easily...The world is overpopulated. I feel alot of marrige happens during the honeymoon stage and thats what breeds resentment and potential divorce. \n\nIm young and a little naiive (only really had flings and hookups before meeting this divine man) are there any tips for people who would rather wait or encouragement to heal before finding a solid partner and not just husband ? If you're raised abroad in a more conservative country and have similar feelings id love to hear your views too.\n\nThanks \ud83c\udf38",

Any insight would be amazing!\nMy first dream I was walking along side of a woman I didn't recognize, she kept telling me I can open the door to the dead. She said a few times. It was weird cause I remember opening an oven door and it was just dark with things floating around.\nThe next dream I was running alongside a man I didn't recognize away from multiple people who were trying to hurt me. We got into a car and I asked the man why these people or beings are after me and he said it's because you are more powerful then them. The feeling though that I got in my dream was a good feeling, like I finally know why certain things happen. Idk. I know they are weird but they are the only 2 dreams I have had with people talking directly to me and guiding me throughout my dream. Maybe they were spirit guides?? Idk, all of this is new to me still so any input is much appreciated! \n\nThank you \ud83d\udc9c",

Once all that takes place the real awakening happens and it is brutal. You learn empathy, sympathy, compassion on so many levels. You become angry at how lonely and cold the world is. People want to claim awakening but why are you still so emotionless? We as humans need interconnectedness and that\u2019s goal of a spiritual awakening is to reach oneness within yourself and the universe. If you\u2019re still uncomfortable with vulnerability whether it\u2019s emotional or physical, you should ask yourself if you\u2019re actually awakened because you become an open light source that embraces love, trauma, heartache, celebration. You can *feel* it all and most people choose not to feel. But feelings, having expectations, and being sensitive, is not a weakness, it\u2019s something you should uphold to and desire.",

          "content": "Hello! \n\nI\u2019ve been struggling to sleep for quite some time, so last night I decided to put on a sleep meditation track to help me drift off. The track itself included a full body scan to easy parts of the body as I tried to drift into sleep. \n\nAs I was trying to focus on parts of the body, my mind began to wander - I am by no means an expert meditator, very much a novice so this isn\u2019t unusual for me. However something happened and I\u2019m really not sure what it was or what happened. \n\nIn short, as I was trying to sleep I felt quite awake and even though my eyes closed I felt as though as was blinking. Not in the sense of I felt the muscles in and around my eyes were blinking, but more of the idea that I physically felt the darkness of blinking overlapping the darkness of having my eyes closed. This happened a few times last night, but is something I\u2019ve experienced before. \n\nWhilst I don\u2019t have an explanation and never have been able to find out what it is, it didn\u2019t bother me as much as the other things. In between 2 of the blinks, I had quite a bright flash of light and saw two different faces very far away from me, almost as if I was viewing them through reel viewer. I don\u2019t know who these people were, they seemed distorted but I felt a comfort within them. As they appeared I felt my body go limp, and after the second face appeared I forced myself to move and open my eyes - as I was quite worried about what I had experienced, mostly because I didn\u2019t know what it was. \n\nHas anyone had something similar, or is aware of anything that sounds like this? Part of me hopes it is something deeper, but I\u2019m also skeptical of myself as I was trying to sleep\n\nAny help is appreciated!",

Where I could float with the stars, jet around the universe all while being serenaded by the chimes and deep hum of space. It was pure ecstasy. I can\u2019t even really explain what was happening to me. I felt like I had been seen by the universe, that I had been allowed to see beyond our existence and peer into the beautiful unknown.\n\nTo this day I\u2019m still inspired by that time, I\u2019m still a believer in that world inside my head, that when my time comes I will end up there for eternity.\n\nI have never done drugs or anything but this experience can only be likened to what I\u2019ve heard from intense mushroom trips. I have no idea what happened to me or why this triggered. I always put it down to the fact that I was near breaking point and my brain just flooded my system with some kinda of ecstasy.\n\nThe song that kicked it all off, and what I ended up naming that world after, was \u2018Void\u2019 by \u2018The Neighbourhood\u2019\n\nHas anyone any idea what I experienced and what this could all mean?",

          "content": "Hi,\n\nI've been in AA for 15 months now and went from a non-believer to working on my spirituality daily. Lately due to some impending family deaths and separations I'm in the process of 'letting go' of every last part of my entire life, and it feels as if I'm free falling in a bottomless hole. Since I've been through a few 'deaths' since joining AA I'm familiar with the feeling but it's feeling a lot more \"all-encompassing\" now that I don't have a conceptual identity left except perhaps my work.\n\nI can accept the feeling when I'm at home but it's painful and hard to try to escape, but since I'm clean and can't escape with drugs or alcohol I can only escape using distractions and gritting my teeth.\n\nBut I get more and more tendencies to re-attach to old parts of my life, or to search for romantic relationship or dysfunctional relationships just to escape through drama or infatuation. It's almost as an automatic defense mechanism triggering when I'm not completely aware in a social situation and then it causes me even more pain when I'm alone since I have to keep myself from stimulating the drama by messages etc.\n\nHow can I learn to stay in this transformation without backpedalling, is it prayer and meditation that holds the key or just pure patience?",

          "content": "Pre-Covid I had it all. Lived in my favourite city (not in my home country), owned a gorgeous little flat. Was fit and healthy and my new coaching business was starting to provide me with a full salary. I thought I\u2019d healed from my past trauma for the most part. I had brilliant health care and a mental health team to fall to in times of crisis. After years of travelling the world, I was super content living a simple, balanced healthy life.\n\nThen covid came alone, at the same time as my 3 good friends moving out of the city. I was alone. I lost all my clients due to budget cuts. My family back in the U.K. weren\u2019t calling, my friends back there were over run with parental duties so had no time to talk. I was approaching 40 and terrified I would not fulfil my dream of having a loving family. It was making me crazy. I started dating a guy and it was going we well until he heard about my past (dysfunctional family, not speaking to my father, etc) and literally dumped me on the spot. It didn\u2019t align with his super close family experience. Covid was slowly breaking me and after being dumped I had a breakdown and was suicidal. I had the blue lights outside the door about to break it down because someone had alerted them to my concerning behaviour. I was released from hospital the next day. That\u2019s where it all started to unravel. My mental health remained rock bottom for months and my friends back home were pushing that I sell up and move back home. I did that.\n\nFor the past 2.5 years I have spent much of the money from the house. Desperate attempts to resurrect my business have failed (you can\u2019t coach when unwell nor market yourself), my friends have barely made time to see me. My family are more closed off than ever due to several deaths in the family. I\u2019ve tried to get a job in a different field but no success competing with people with experience. I now cannot afford to rent and can\u2019t even get a rental in a cheap place because I have no salary and biz accounts minimal and nobody will be my guarantor. So Ive been living in a van for the past 8 months. At first it felt empowering but now I feel like a homeless person.\n\nSo where I am today is stuck. Backed up in the corner believing it is inevitable that I will end my life. Not this week but maybe in a month or 2, or 6 months. My brain is preparing it all and psyching up. I DO NOT want this to be the story. And at the same time I don\u2019t see any other way. My family don\u2019t get me, I will not have my own family, im undateable atm, lost my flat, blown most of my money, can\u2019t run my business or get a job, remaining friends not able to support. It feels like I\u2019ve already died because I\u2019m at such a distance from the world.\n\nPart of my brain is trying to help me to survive this. Searching for solutions and actions to take. Trying to create a new vision for the future but I don\u2019t see one. I feel like my only hope is my spirituality and seeking a different perspective for all this.\n\nCan anyone help with this?",

Just lost on the journey.\n\nThis spiritual journey is a lonely one, I think I'm at the point where I'm hitting a bit of a wall, I'm about a year in to a spiritual awareness/ awakening hitting me and I'm finding it very isolating and difficult at this moment. Feels each day it's getting worse and trying to find a way to stop it asap. \n\nThere may be multiple reasons for this and especially around this time of year as 8 years ago I lost my grandpa early in the month and lost my grandma 2 years ago on Halloween night. Throw in multiple birthdays through the month and Halloween events, and heading into the winter months. October is always very overwhelming for me. The past 4 years I've gotten intense depression like clockwork every October.\n\nI was doing well up until the last 5 days or so and it's hit me like a ton of bricks again, the amount of people in my life who understand or can relate is absolutely zero. ( they try but don't really understand) I'm still not even sure what is happening really on some days as well. Most days, I'm very strong mentally and very sure on things and some days it's the exact opposite and just constant noise in my head that's just pure distraction. The stress from working constantly full time and having no time for anything else is also crushing me at the moment. \n\nI am truly grateful for what I have at the moment but at the same time it's exactly opposite of what i truly want and what my inner soul is telling me I need over the past 6-12 months. Circumstances out of my control as health issues of others/ insane rent costs just to get a one bedroom tin can apartment are impede my moving forward with my partner. Health issues/ work doesn't allow us to see each other more than once a week most weeks, and it's been like this for many years were it's just being stuck in the same cycle and that dream is always just out of reach because of expenses( getting worse) and family members health issues.\n\nExample is that was supposed to see each other tonight and had to cancel because covid is floating around my workplace, so can't risk getting their family member sick. It's really disheartening when it's the only thing I'm looking forward too and then it falls through.( Not going to put them in potentially endangering their loved one, but just a shitty situation).\n\nLive in a city small apartment barley scraping by and when nature is my true home and is calling me to it. I do realize this sounds like complaining when I realize so many others have so little and have been through souch worse and that I'm lucky to not be so much worse off. \n\nI guess I'm just lacking connection on a deeper level and don't really know where to turn next on this path. So this is me reaching out to the universe, on one of the most amazing pieces of technology and the most amazing communication tool we have in the interwebs. \nIt's truly remarkable source of communication and information. \n\nBeen doing the work to clear out my traumas and get rid of substance absue issues that I was using for covering up those trauma's from my teen years. Definitely not going to stop or quit as this is the way forward but just reaching out.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas, groups, links, or information or really anything you could suggest to help me on my journey and struggles at this current time. It would be very much appreciated from this wandering soul looking for a sign. \n\nThanks for reading this long post as well!! :) \nCan be therapeutic writing it all out and putting it out there!",

I felt very understood and seen when I was speaking to them and I can\u2019t even explain the feeling but I felt very safe and comfortable. We were very very similar In both good and bad ways anyway I feel as though he was my karma and I felt like he made me very aware of my avoidant attachment issues which in this case actually turned into anxious (bc like I said we were very similar). \n\nAnyways after this experience I feel as though I want to learn how to open my heart up to receiving and giving love. I can finally admit to itself that I want to be able to have a connection with someone else that\u2019s as deep as the one I have with myself. However, I have extreme issues with being vulnerable and I have the tendency to count things out for myself before even trying. My mom raised me with a very very hyper-independent mindset and instilled values within me such as don\u2019t rely on anybody, learn how to do everything yourself, no point in showing  your emotions, don\u2019t cry about things etc etc. however the issue for me is I feel like I\u2019ve been cursed with an annoying amount of emotional awareness ( which I can admit is hyper vigilance masking as self improvement. it's really fear of failure) so I\u2019m aware of all these issues but I\u2019m not sure how to actually stop them. \n\nI have a million more questions and no one to talk about spiritual topics with, I want to add that I do believe in God but not in a rigid sense. If anyone could recommend me any books or even message me with any advice about this subject or any others that you think could help me on this journey I\u2019d appreciate it so so much.

          "content": "my spiritual cleanse includes sharing this w the community, you fellow spiritual enlightment and truth seekers as witnesses.\n\nThe astrologer - connected to my mother - has explained once more what he thinks about my birth chart.  \nI\u2019m writing this down, bc deep down I know, there is a lot of junk of what he said. He used to instill deep seated doubts and crippling, paralyzing insecurity, also bc he predicted \u2013 not mine thank God, and I\u2019m praying for continual protection \u2013 accidents and sicknesses of others, just everything related to negative, accurately to a day (plus minus three) via progressive chart.  \nI started to do some spiritual cleansing, through journaling I\u2019ve come to the conclusion, how much toxic and subtle emotional abuse and manipulation has been going on.\n\nAs part of my healing process I share w you what he says.  \n(I am not a newbie in astrology, bc of the astrologer\u2019s traumatizing words, haunted me for years I have researched a lot. I had the inclination, even tho I knew deep down, there was something wrong w what that person say, I allowed the person\u2019s words to claim power over in my life. I am a very spiritually sensitive, so I know what words can cause IF you give them power. especially by ppl like this astrologer \u2013 he claims to be always right, then continues to tell you about all the negative things he has predicted right in other ppl\u2019s life.)\n\nThe reason I share his interpretation here, bc I believe it is part of my (healing) journey. I am doing this and simultaneously I am reclaiming my REAL identity. The person, the higher power who created me, made me to be. by posting his - imho- junk interpretation I am declaring to the spiritual and the material world that i am spiritually cutting off ALL bonds, and chains he has put upon me. I am reclaiming my power over my life -and breaking whatever power he might have over me- w the higher power having the ultimate power over my life.  \nby doing that, i am also raising more and more awareness at whenever I need to set boundaries and put up a shield when that astrologer is trying to (re)claim power - he often just \"means it well and wants to help\".\n\nIf you have any divine-inspired thoughts you want to share, I thank you in advance.  \nActually I have written my own interpretation of my birth chart - mainly focusing on my Venus-Moon opposition and the nodes \u2013 [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advancedastrology/comments/17373ch/my_interpretation_of_12h_6h_polarity_venussn_12h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (in case you might want to read it as well)\n\nmy birth chart is [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/12thhouse/comments/167fn14/the_hard_to_put_in_words_longing_for_ethereal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nHis - imho mainly wrong - interpretation:  \nYears ago, he told me I\u2019m not going to have intercourse very often. However I will be able to experience pleasure \u2013 more intense \u2013 than average ppl. However, this will happen very, very, very rarely. These pleasurable experiences will be intense, but very short lived and I will be very alone. there will be dry periods for a very very long time in between.\n\nHe recently explained why: his reason for the aforementioned, is bc of my tight Capricorn Saturn-Neptune conjunction in the 5H. Acc to him, the 5H is the house of pleasure, and bc Saturn is domicile and ruler here, there is no fun. His words about Neptune: Neptune is nothingness. Saturn wants to restrict, w Neptune-nothingness here, what\u2019s there to restrict.\n\n(I tried w him, over several years discussing w him. Until I realized recently, he is one of these guys \u2013 yes, his predictions of all things related to sickness and stuff of other ppl was accurate \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like it when you challenge him. When our argument gets heated \u2013 for example I said Venus in Pisces is exalted, why do you say so much negative about my Leo Venus 12H - and there is nothing he can say: he says \u201cYou\u2019re talking so much junk right now, it\u2019s unbearable. And then proceeds on telling me, how right he was about others, he is never wrong \u2013 which of course made me so crippingly insecure in the past. Bc how could a astrologer who could predict sicknesses, accidents and even worse precise to three days, be wrong? See the subtle abuse, I was putting myself up w?)\n\nyears he said something like, I\u2019m not going to have a relationship, a usual one that is. Bc my descendant is in Pisces and since my 7H is empty and pisces means d\\*ath (back then I was like? What? But his \u201cother accurate predictions\u201d instilled a deep seated crippling fear)\n\nthen he said: I live my 7H through my 12H. since my Leo Venus 12H is there. The Venus is \u201cafflicted\u201d, bc 12H is the house of undoing. The Venus is dissolving itself, disintegrating. A natural desire of Venus is to be w someone, but here \u2026 afflicted. bc how can a dissolving Venus be, do Venusian?\n\nWhen I mentioned the lunar nodes, he once said to ignore the annoying nodes, then said he meant it in a way that I just saw my nodes in relation to my planets and nothing more.",

And what was one thing you wish you did differently / had been prepared for prior? \n\nThe last time I did inner child healing was about two years ago. I had done a soul retrieval with a shaman, some work with any other, as well as some self work on my own using the book Greater than the sum of our parts by Richard Schwartz. I really enjoyed that method but I struggled early on with connecting to my inner child vs. my conscious mind taking the wheel. I\u2019m more aligned with my intuition these days.\n\nI know a lot of people have shared working in tandem with a psychologist/ counselor. I have had a really hard time finding the right fit and after paying out of pocket for 2 that we\u2019re not experienced in the level of work I wanted to do. I\u2019m trying to find an provider that takes my insurance but want to move forward and take it slow. \n\nAnyways. Thank you again. \ud83d\udc95",

          "content": "This radiation is the euphoric energy that is present when experiencing frisson/chills/goosebumps.  \n\n\nResearchers have witnessed certain test subjects who were able to consciously emit this form of energy from their bodies.  \n\n\nFor those who doubt that Chi/Qi/Prana/Aura are demonstrably and quantifiably associated with infrared energy in the human body, here's a Harvard study of the Tibetan people who use this same energy under a different name called Tummo to raise their body temperature.  \n\n\n[https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/harvard-study-confirms-tibetan-monks-can-raise-body-temperature-with-their-minds/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/harvard-study-confirms-tibetan-monks-can-raise-body-temperature-with-their-minds/)  \n\n\n[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058244](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058244)  \n\n\nAnd a paper from the CIA website on the accuracy of the Qi(Spiritual chills) and its usage through the eastern practice of Qigong.  \n\n\n[https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000300400002-9.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000300400002-9.pdf)  \n\n\n''Chinese scientists, using arrays of modern detectors, tried to monitor emissions originating from qigong masters. They met with partial success by detecting increased levels of infrared radiation. Interestingly, the emission oscillated with a low frequency''  \n\n\nNow that that's out of the way, lets continue.  \n\n\nAs the Taoist concept of Chi crossed over into the West in recent years, the Western word Bio-electricity was coined to describe it since Chi has a number of properties that seem similar to those of electrical energy.  \n\n\nChi is the equivalent to what can be considered your \"Spiritual energy\".   \n\n\nA simple definition for spiritual energy is that blissful wave that can most easily be felt/recognized as present while you get goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli.  \n\n\nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.  \n\n\nLearning how to extract that euphoria from our physical reaction is the key for that and to benefit from the many positive physical and spiritual usages that gaining control of this brings you.  \n\n\nThis energy has been documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.  \n\n\nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) going more in-depth on how to control your energy and to understand where it comes from.  \n\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on r/spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it. ",

We stayed for four days during this trip and the second day we decided to smoke a joint, around evening maybe 630 me and my sister went outside on the porch and the smoked whole thing. I remember taking the last few hits off the roach, putting it back inside the dube tube and walking back inside to my bedroom. This is where the experience began. The high felt normal as I smoked million times before but I remember laying back onto the bed and seeing geometric objects forming in front of me I was a bit taken aback, but having experienced LSD and mushrooms I wasn\u2019t too shaken as I laid on the bed, staring at these objects. the ceiling fan above, begin to put me into a trance, I remember becoming hyper fixated an the wall sort of melting. I remember looking down at my body to see this greenish brownish aura arising, and I could feel a pull as if I was going with it, and at that moment, I remember feeling myself rise from my body into the room and then turn in the air to look back at myself, lying in the bed. At the time we were going to dinner with the family so I felt this urge this feeling, as if I couldn\u2019t leave as if I couldn\u2019t go, but this Pull or cosmic feeling was telling me that I needed to learn, but when I resisted and told it I couldn\u2019t leave, and I couldn\u2019t learn. It abruptly told me I wasn\u2019t ready and forced me back into my body. I remember jolting out of bed taking a huge breath of air, my eyes wide, completely dilated pupils my ears were ringing so loudly I was trying to act normal as if nothing happened and unable to hear anything they\u2019re saying things to me with this ringing taking up my entire conscience. I know something just happened I could feel it. There was something different about that experience. There was something that told me that I needed to learn but I wasn\u2019t ready. What do I do ?? I\u2019ve tried meditation and DMT another psychedelics, but I\u2019ve never experienced something like that. And I\u2019m unable to replicate it. I would like to either understand what happened or opinions. Sorry for so long and any spelling errors.",

          "content": "\nBy Alessandro Carosi\n\n\nI was in Brighton this weekend and first thing coming out from the train station was obviously drinking a coffee, I wanted the first from a coffee shop that I remember from my last visit called Pelicano but on my way an other one caught my attention \u2026. called Ikigai, I thought to be Japanese and the minimalistic design in wood that\u2019s my style so I had to try it.\n\nI get inside order a filter and chit chatting find out that the owner wasn\u2019t Japanese but from Hong Kong, the cafe\u2019 design and name deceived me but never mind cause the reason to chose it was my interest for Japan and that I\u2019m studying Japanese but coffee especially coffee doesn\u2019t have nationalities and borders at least in my own world.\n\nThe guy didn\u2019t disappoint me delivering one of the nicest filters I had for a long time and kindly enough he brewed an other one from a Hong Kong roastery that was just wonderful, felt like I was drinking a lemon grass tea, he knows his job and you could tell the passion as well.\n\nI\u2019m not writing about coffee here even if look like and obviously coffee is one of my life calls and purpose, the reason behind this article is what happend toward the end \u2026.. I tell him I would follow on Instagram and drop a message so that he knows is me, before leaving I say that my IG account name is Nomad barista that will be who send the msg and hearing that he tells me that a friend talked about me before, I was like \u2026\u2026. What?? Are you sure??? I thought to be a mistake but when he tells me that his friend from Taiwan living in Guilford been in London and met me I remebered who was it, we met in a cafe\u2019 in Chelsea and had a great chat about coffee and then met again in Islington where we tried some coffee she brought from Taiwan.\n\nCan you see the connection? The dots getting togheter at some point? The energy that connects all of us? The invisible thread?\n\nI live in London and in Brighton for a couple of days having a coffee in a cafe\u2019 thinking to be from Japan but owned by a guy from Hong Kong, we talk about coffee and we end up knowing the same person that lives in Guilford an other town not too far from Brighton and London, look at the wonderful spider net of connections and synchronicities, can you still call it coincidence even things like this happened thousands of times?\n\nWe are united by a force that we can\u2019t see but exist and we been told that our lives is our work and all is based on money and stock markets and an endless buying and selling materialistic items of which most of it of no value, can you see that what we been told till now is a lie? There is more much more than what we can see, smell and hear.\n\nWake up folks, wake up to your own immense power, begin to discover your inner self and learning that a different way to live is possible.",

For example, if you fail at something and repeatedly keep failing. You just sorta get in the habit of failing and eventually become careless like oh well, I failed in the past and current might as well fail in future.

          "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nIm new to the community, I was just coming on here to somewhat seek for reassurance haha! For a quick backstory im diagnosed with OCD and have struggled immensely with anxiety the majority of my life. This past year was a very hard year for me, my OCD symptoms really surfaced to its full potential. I went through a breakup after being with my SO for 5 years due to these symptoms, the first 3-4 months after the breakup was hard but a literal switch flicked overnight in like June, I had no more anxiety, OCD symptoms, sadness, stress, I was at overall peace within myself. I felt like I was on top of the world for the first little bit because this sensation of Being was within me. After that point I started craving natures presence, I was hiking a lot, opening a lot of time outdoors. Although I work full time I was felt myself craving this feeling of being outside and just exploring the world. Like it was such a strange feeling, it was taking over me. It was an amazing month and I spent a lot of time outside and was fully at peace. I had a slight hiccup in my life last week and I spent a lot of time down in the dumps, I was experiencing a lot of sadness but I welcomed the emotions I was experiencing. I kept questioning whether or not what I've been striving for is real or not. What initially reignited my willingness to explore and be one with nature was unfortantely a tiktok video I came across, it really inspired me to start doing what I love again. Due to my crazy OCD mind, I've been having these continuous the intrusive thoughts that keep circulating in my brain which are: \"do you even enjoy doing this?\" \"is this even you?\" \"am I forcing a spiritual awakening or do I genuinely feel this presence?\" \n\nIts hard for me to navigate through these intrusive thoughts because I am so passionate about becoming more mindful, spiritually in touch with myself, being one with nature, and just being overall enlightened in my life. After my hard week last week I made a plan for myself, its not forced, this all came from trial and error through my depressive week. Every morning I started off by listening to a podcast that ia relevant to however im feeling in that moment and I write out a lengthy entry in my journal. It usually starts off negative but leads to a more positive affirming entry. I then listen to a guided meditation depending on how im feeling that day. For example, this morning I woke up and I was a little bit stressed, mostly because of these scary intrusive thoughts I've been having; I just don't want to be portraying a fake image of myself through delusion. im start enough to know that this is not delusion and that this is genuinely how I feel in my life right now but my OCD will usually have the upper hand in these kinds of situations and say \"ya but what if you're wrong?\" These are the first intrusive thoughts I've had since I started this spiritual journey.\n\nAnyways, this is turning into a brainless emotion dump but I would really like to hear some insight. its hard for me to put everything into words because this is just a feeling, its hard to write it down. I hope this reaches the right people:)",

Now, as an adult my beliefs have changed in many ways. First off let me clarify, I was never a Bible thumping Christian with strong  and unshakable faith. As I've aged and have studied and debated and shared my own thoughts and listened to others I feel more spiritual. I believe in bits and pieces from multiple different religions. For example,  I believe in reincarnation. I believe that Hell on Earth is not a simple saying. I think we are put on earth to suffer and to find ourselves and how to be...a good person? One with the universe? Enlightened? I'm not sure...but, if you're a shit person..guess what.....youll be someone'sThanksgiving turkey in your next life. That homeless person you threw your garbage at? They'll be an owl and you'll be the rat in your next lives. I also don't think there is a one, singular God. Honestly if there is, I think he/she got bored and walked away from us a loooong time ago. If God is real.....I'm not going to worship a person that attempts to teach love, but hates so hard. Or a person (or entity/God/whatever) that is all knowing...so they know i dont believeand i will sin and i will go to hell?.....ok then....why bother? I feel like I bounce around a lot, and am exploring and learning more and more everyday....i really like the person im becoming and think my journey is interesting and may be interesting to others as well...I'd love to hear about what you believe too.",

Like last night I woke up and was convinced there was smoke in the room and eventually realized there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen such a huge variety of things and most of what I\u2019ve seen lately is hard to describe. I try to reach out and touch it and it takes me a while to ground back to this reality.\n\nThis has happened a lot in the past too, before I had a spiritual awakening. At first they were full on night terrors where I\u2019d wake up screaming and jump out of bed. But eventually I learned how to ground myself and not panic. When it got really persistently bad my doctor put me on antipsychotics and it stopped so I stopped the pills after a couple months. Then it would only come back briefly.\n\nBut it\u2019s been very consistent again. I thought it was lack of sleep but I started getting more sleep and it got worse and I started seeing some stuff during the day. My acupuncturist told me it could be beings from the other side of the veil trying to communicate and to set boundaries repeatedly. After the daytime stopped and nighttime stopped for a couple days. But the nighttime is back and won\u2019t seem to go away no matter what boundaries I try to set.\n\nSo now I am not sure what to think is happening. Anyone out there reading this who is familiar with this kind of thing and knows how to tell the difference between some spiritual weirdness happening or some non-spiritual mental issue that just needs drugs? I don\u2019t want to medicate again if this is just another spiritual awakening type thing that I need to learn how to deal with better, but if it\u2019s not that then maybe I do need to try meds again.\n\nNot sure so thought I\u2019d see if anyone out there has experience with this because there\u2019s not exactly a lot of spiritually awakened Western medical doctors out there that I can consult \ud83d\ude10",

However, the workers noticed something peculiar about him. \n\nWhile Oscar usually preferred to be alone, he occasionally crawled into a resident's bed and snuggled beside them. \n\nThe eerie thing about this is that the resident that Oscar would cuddle with would usually die within hours.\n\nInitially, the staff didn't think much of it, but after this happened 20 times, they started to believe that Oscar knew when someone was close to passing away, and so when they noticed the cat next to a resident, they would call their loved ones to warn them. \n\nResearchers speculate that Oscar could smell biochemicals released by dying cells and so chose to comfort lonely residents.\n\nOn one occasion, the staff was convinced that a resident was about to pass away, but Oscar refused to sit with them. Instead, he chose another resident who looked healthier, and that person passed away first.\n\nOscar died in 2022, and over the course of his life he accurately predicted over 100 deaths.\u201d\n\nway to go oscar \ud83d\udd49\ufe0f\ud83e\udeb7\ud83c\udf3f",

The first are glowing/transparent orbs that are made of energy specifically related to an energy/emotion/vibration/frequency that is either being sent out from you or drawn to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second type that you can also come in contact with are made of non-physical being/spirit or being used as a vehicle for a consciousness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese Orbs can and have been spotted in photos/videos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what I researched and learned after having experienced multiple contacts with them. Most of those contacts happened while I was circulating my spiritual energy. I'd even go as far as to say that ever since I started circulating this spiritual energy is when I started noticing them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA simple definition for spiritual energy is that blissful wave that can most easily be felt/recognized as present while you get goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring one of my meditation sessions, As I was sweeping my whole body up then down with this energy while feeling intense gratitude, I saw from my half closed eyes, a golden orb the size of a grapefruit approach me and enter my body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was one of the first times I experienced those orbs in 2013. I still do to this day and I know this was successful thanks to the circulation of that blissful wave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis energy has been researched and documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearning how to do this is really simple.\n\nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) that will introduce you to this energy, help you feel it on command, witness these orbs and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on [r/spiritualchills](http://r/spiritualchills) where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",

(ALSO in our 2012 facebook messages I realized he met my sister once before too) (ALSO this situation is even more intriguing to me because I don't remember him, but talked to him over messenger everyday in 2011/2012)\n\nDo you guys think this was divine or random chance?\n\nAlso, he asked if I wanted to meet up and I said yes and it's been 7 days and he hasn't followed up.

(Sorry I\u2019m still getting my terms right\u2026) has been triggering fear and panic in me resulting in a sort of amplified anxiety. I would have sudden palpitations and instantly my brain would think of all the ways this could go south and make things worse. I\u2019ve been isolating a lot, wfh for a while. I gotta get back next week. Videos from Christina Lopes have been truly helpful. But despite knowing that I\u2019m experiencing everything she described and that there\u2019s \u201cno reason\u201d to be afraid\u2026 I cannot get rid of this fear/strange panic. I\u2019m also on the autism spectrum so some emotions are naturally amplified for me making things more challenging.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?

          "content": "good morning \ud83c\udf18 today is a big day in many regards\n\n* friyay is the end of a typical work week \n* friyay the 13th is the first day the Knights Templar were rounded up and jailed, only to have some burned at the stake after serving the church for hundreds of years \n* today specifically, in these particularly dark days on earth, there are some who are calling for militant attacks on innocent in the \u2018name of THEIR god\u2019 today \n\nalways perplexes me when I hear supposed religious, faithful or devout people yak about their loving god .. and then those very people are the first ones to take up arms for their loving god against another who has a different loving god \ud83e\udd7a how and why do humans constantly get god so wrong \ud83d\ude14\n\nNO god calls for nor approves of death in their name, especially christ \n\nthat said: I am choosing today to share with you someone elses words about christ, which I read a few months ago and found quite intriguing \ud83e\udd14 for you know my opinion on the church, the bible, modern day christianity and the damn vatican: none have anything whatsoever to do with christ \ud83d\udc9c\n\nso read this and please share your thoughts with me \ud83d\ude4f\n\n\n\u201cJesus didn't teach ascension\"\n\nOf course he did. It's one of his primary teachings. Jesus is as New Age as it gets. He literally promised a New Heaven and a New Earth.\n\nThe problem is that modern Christians are following Church doctrine, not Jesus's teachings. They repeat 1 or 2 verses which are inaccurate representations of what he said.\n\n\"There is no way to the father but through me\"\n\nFirst of all, what does this have to do with being murdered for God? Nothing. So why do modern Christians disregard his teachings in favor of a pagan blood sacrifice?\n\nJesus spoke Aramaic. No one tries to research what he really said because it reverses much of what the Church taught.\n\nHe said ABWOON (Source) not ABBA (Father). His entire message was about God being within us. There is no way to Source but to go within. His message is the only way, not worship of angry gods ordering murder and slavery (anunnaki). Not once did Jesus refer to Yahweh-Jehovah as God.\n\nJesus didn't say he would return to rule this world as a king, he said he'd take us where he is. A place where \"many mansions\" are prepared (5D Earth). \n\nWhat will happen? \"In a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be  changed; one will be taken and one will be left behind.\" (People will vanish)\n\nHow will we know it's coming? \"At that time they will see the Son of Man (like humans) coming in a cloud with power and great glory (UFOs).\u00a0When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.\u201d\n\nJesus didn't practice blood rituals to God so he couldn't have been a final sacrifice to his own God. He never mentioned Yahweh or Jehovah at all. He didn't claim he was going to die for our sins. In the story, he didn't volunteer, he was betrayed.\n\nHe taught that God was within and we will do even greater miracles. Modern Christians mindlessly repeats slogans like \"Jesus is King\", and are clear they believe more in the power of demons than angels.\n\nJesus didn't create religion. He didn't travel around telling people he was God. He said the kingdom of God is within us, that we are gods too, and we will do greater miracles than he did.\n\nChurch doctrine is brainwashing to keep you away from what Jesus taught.\u201d\n\nI M H O: this is 100000% on point \u2728 tell me your thought and please .. be safe today\n\nbe humble, small, sober and vigilant .. for the forces of evil are closer than ever \ud83e\udeb7",

          "content": "For the past few months I've been seeing silhouettes when I close my eyes. 90% of the time it is a female silhouette and a male silhouette walking towards each other and embracing each other. Occasionally they are kissing. Other times I only see the female silhouette looking around as if she's looking for the male silhouette. Now this started after meeting my ex. We were absolutely perfect together and loved each other. It felt like our souls were meant to be together. We'd lay down and stare into each others eyes and it just felt so right. He broke it off to go to Europe as he had been planning to go there and find himself and figure out what he wants in life. i don't blame him. He told me I was probably the love of his life and he'd have nightmares about our break up for the rest of his life. I'm not sure if he ever plans on coming back. I feel horrible as I told him I would hate him if he left. But it's been four months and I still love him so goddamn much that it kills me inside. The idea of being with someone else makes me dizzy and want to throw up. I love him and he was my favorite person. My dreams are filled with us reuniting and it hurts to wake up. I've been getting into meditation and trying to connect with a higher power because I'm so tired of missing him and want to feel complete by myself. Nothing works though. Every manifestation has appeared in my life except him. I manifested a promotion and I got it. I manifested my dad getting a job and he got it the next day. I manifest money and it comes. Sometimes I can almost feel him holding me at night like he's actually there but it fades when I pull myself out of the fantasy. I'm conflicted in staying in my fantasy and memories of him. Sometimes I try not to but he always pops up in my head, even to simple things like someone saying something he used to say. The pain of his absence is no longer unbearably but l'm still always missing him hoping for his return. What do these visions mean? Why can't I get him out of my head? How am I supposed to let go when even the hug of another reminds me of him.",

The feelings of betrayal hurt more than the physical scars sometimes. \n\nI feel like being raped by a stranger took away my trust in others and the world around me. It was the first time in my life I knew for certain that evil exists and truly horrifying shit happens in our world that we can\u2019t control. \n\nAfter someone I considered a friend raped me it felt like an even bigger betrayal. I could handle the betrayal of a stranger, but now even friends aren\u2019t safe!? I trusted them and our friendship and they took advantage of my trust. It sucked and a part of me felt heartbroken because of their betrayal. \n\nA man I dated on and off for 4 years verbally and sexually abused me. He raped me too many times to count or remember them all. I loved him and he claimed he loved me. I was young and lacking self-confidence. Growing up no one ever taught me how to love myself or my body. All I was shown was how to criticize and condemn my body for not being skinny enough, flawless enough, perfect enough\u2026 He was the first person in my life who showed me how to love my body exactly as it is. He made me feel beautiful and accepted, perfect including my flaws. I felt confident and sexy in my body for the first time. But he took advantage of my sensuality and found it fun to exert his physical strength in order to get what he wanted from me: sex. He disregarded my boundaries. He felt entitled to do whatever he wanted just because he was stronger than me and could.\nI loved him and trusted him not to hurt me, but he did. His betrayal hurts the most because we shared so many intimate and vulnerable moments. I had love in my heart for him and I know in some (unhealthy) way he did too. I feel like an idiot for allowing myself to be vulnerable and open myself up to a fucking predator. I hate that his actions have affected the way I see relationships and how hard it is to be vulnerable and 100% all in again. \n\nMy heart hurts. My heart feels heavy from so much betrayal. My heart wants nothing more than to be open, free and loving again but it feels like the only way to get back there is through all the shit. But feeling all this betrayal and sadness hurts so much! I want to trust again but I don\u2019t know how. \n\nMy heart is broken and I just hope that this isn\u2019t the end of the journey. That my heart can be broken open. That there is some reason to this fucking madness. That I had to experience so much heartache in order to know the exact opposite of true, unconditional love and trust. And to find that again somehow.",

In my mind its totally possible for humanity to be liberated (most important step of them all) and then we can have a gradual shift into the new golden age where many of us might ascend on the way and those who aren't able to do so yet, will simply incarnate on other planets which will still support their frequency.\n\nHow do you see it play all out?\u201d\n\nme (edited):\ngreat question, how this all plays out \ud83c\udf3f and one to which I certainly do not \u2018the\u2019 answer yet I will happily share my own perspective based on years of research, studies of ancient philosophies, faith and real history \u2026\n\nI believe there will be an immediate transcendence very soon \u2728 \n\nthose with Eyes Wide Open shall simply slide into their new world .. those who do not \u2018see\u2019 will not join us and remain here as life on earth plays out \n\nhowever, what is happening simultaneous to this upcoming event, is that ALL death, purposefully or through accidental yet pre calculated potential, which had been caused by another human or non terrestrial .. whether by war, trafficking and enslavement, forced drugs and poisoning, etc; ie:\n\nthose who have been murdered prematurely shall have transcended immediately if they were innocent, genuine and kind, held souls which were pure and had hearts of true gratitude \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\n\nhence even though all of these horrifying events taking place today will NEVER be justified .. the souls taken early and heinously shall never be forgotten  \ud83e\udeb7\n\nin this way, as hard as the blackened, soulless entities work to tease and snatch away the good souls from the Light, the Light is ever present and will always welcome the true of heart, immediately easing all pain and suffering \ud83d\udc9c the Light may not have yet to interfere in this nightmare yet is omnipresent to ensure no one is left behind \ud83c\udf39\n\nremember this earth is but a weigh station and is not permanent so fret not if your time here is quickened as you have every opportunity to return once again if you wish \ud83e\udebb\n\nplease know the One, the Truth, the Light which I choose to follow .. christ, buddha and all the star gods .. also include every kind, honest, true sentient being whether human or animal \n\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc3e\u262e\ufe0f\n\nwould love to know your thoughts and experiences in \u2018what happens next\u2019 so please share \n\nand please: these wars are literally ENDLESS \ud83d\ude16 and NO one ever wins .. do not engage, take sides or promote anger and hate in any capacity \n\n\ud83d\udc9a especially now \ud83d\udc9b \n\nlove you",

          "author": "Cultural_Change1948",
          "content": "I'm 22 years old, and for a long time now, I've had the feeling that my soul is constantly tormented, even tortured. I've never truly been \"happy\" or at peace with myself and the world around me. I've never been satisfied with my life, and I'm starting to wonder if true happiness is even possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm seriously questioning whether anyone in this world can genuinely be happy and fulfilled. I wonder if happiness is attainable for humans, who always seem to want more and are never content with their current situation. This perpetual desire has been essential for human survival and accomplishments, but it inevitably leads to suffering due to a sense of lack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm beginning to wonder if humans are destined to suffer indefinitely and if happiness is, in fact, just an illusion. This question troubles me even more in our current society, where I see few people truly happy. It's also possible that fulfillment doesn't lie so much in achieving desires but in the pursuit itself, which can briefly bring happiness. However, these moments of happiness are fleeting, and soon sadness, resentment, and other negative emotions take hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm becoming more and more confused, questioning why we live, work, and possess consciousness, and whether life has any meaning. It all seems absurd, especially when considering our insignificance on the cosmic scale and the transitory nature of our planet. So, we're condemned to act as though everything is normal, to get up every morning, go to work, knowing that each of our actions seems ridiculously insignificant. It's so absurd that it becomes almost comical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost people act as though everything is fine, because once you lift the veil of absurdity, it becomes challenging to function in society. Currently, I struggle to find the motivation to get up in the morning, take the subway, and work for what appears to be a purposeless endeavor. Some people turn to religion to escape this absurdity, but it seems both enviable and sad because they sacrifice their lives in the hope of a reward in the afterlife.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, life seems absurd, insignificant, and devoid of meaning, often filled with more suffering and sacrifice than moments of joy. I'm not sure if I'm going through depression, losing my mind, or experiencing what's called a \"dark night of the soul\" and a spiritual awakening. I hope that a spiritual awakening is real, but there's also the fear that I might simply be descending into madness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy identity has always been built on my academic achievements, often at the top of my class and excelling in scientific subjects. After high school, I enrolled in a prestigious engineering school, but I didn't last long. In class, I was already asking existential questions like, \"What's the point?\" \"Why is this useful?\" \"Why?\" The idea of spending the rest of my life studying or working seemed absurd, and I wondered if that was all life had to offer. I was disgusted and depressed, and I eventually gave up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still wonder if it was a mistake to drop out of university. On one hand, I think that if I had worked hard and obtained a good job, social status, a high salary, and the associated recognition, it might have spared me from asking all these existential questions that trouble me now. On the other hand, I fear that I wouldn't have found fulfillment as an engineer, and I would have lived a life of \"falsehood,\" or at least a life where I would be blind to the reality of existence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom this failure, my self-image has been shattered. Me, who was always brilliant in science, is now abandoning university. My ego is in tatters. In any case, one thing is certain: today, I'm lost. I don't know who I am, where I come from, why I'm conscious, and what life really is. And, most importantly, how can I continue to function in this world while pondering so many existential questions? It's absurd. I don't know why I'm posting this. Partly, it's to externalize my thoughts, write them down, clarify them, and organize them to better understand them. Partly, it's also because I'm seeking answers, even though I know the hope of finding them may be futile.",

It\u2019s human nature.) and so the human mind manifested these beings and objects. It turned out easier to blame these manifestations and thus we started to blame demons and possessions taking place instead of our own actions. Well since the human conscious has progressed, we no longer hallucinate and that\u2019s why it takes substances that lower our conscious to start hallucinating. But to speak on hallucinations with depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia it\u2019s because the person sits in despair constantly, and becomes inept and unable to control their own human conscious. This leads to the need for the brain chemicals to be balanced by pharmaceuticals that weren\u2019t available in the times of Jesus Christ, so that is another reason why we do not see the same kind of \u201cpossessions\u201d now, and when we do it\u2019s a mass murder or a gruesome, violent act done by someone who sat in despair.",

          "author": "Harmonyhikes",
          "content": "Greetings, fellow seekers of self-knowledge and development of the self!\n\nToday, let's take a transformative visit inside of ourselves to explore the road of self-discovery and its tremendous effects on personal development.\n\n***1. Unveiling the Inner Journey:***\n\nThe inner voyage is an exploration of your own being, which is unexplored ground.\n\n  \nIt's a journey of self-discovery and self-awareness, an effort to comprehend the complexities of your ideas, feelings, and the core of who you really are.  \n\n\n***2. Why Start Your Inner Journey?***\n\nThe inner trip is essential for human development; it is not only a luxury. It acts as a compass to direct you toward a better knowledge of who you are, your goals, and your life's work.\n\n  \nIt gives you the ability to overcome challenges, develop resilience, and lead a more genuine and satisfying life.  \n\n\n***3. The First Step Is Self-Discovery***\n\nThe foundation of the inner journey is self-discovery. It entails meditation on oneself and the bravery to face one's strengths and faults.\n\n  \nTo unveil your genuine nature, you must strip away layers of conditioning and cultural expectations.  \n\n\n***4. Seeking Self-Awareness***\n\nThe prize you seek on the journey is self-awareness. It is the capacity to objectively observe your ideas, feelings, and behaviors.\n\n  \nYou develop an understanding of your habits, motives, and wants via mindfulness and introspection.  \n\n\n***5. Accepting Growth and Change***\n\nThe inevitable result of self-awareness and self-discovery is personal progress.  \n\n\nYour ability to adapt to change, overcome obstacles, and make decisions that are consistent with your real self improves as you become more aware of your inner landscape.  \n\n\n***6. Resources for Inner Growth***\n\nThere are several techniques and tools that may be used to go through the inner journey:\n\n**- Mindfulness:**  \nA method that fosters mental calmness, clarity, and increased self-awareness.\n\n  \n**- Journal writing:**  \nYou may see trends and keep a record of your own development by writing down your ideas and feelings.\n\n  \n**- Being mindful:**  \nYour ability to be totally in the moment might help you become more self-aware.\n\n  \n**- Looking for Advice:**  \nYou can use books, mentors, therapists, and spiritual practices as guidance along the way.  \n\n\n***7. Accepting What Is Unknown***\n\nThe inner journey doesn't follow a straight route to a predetermined endpoint. It's a spiral that pulls you more within.\n\n  \nYou could have times of deep insight, discomfort, and doubt along the road. Accept these experiences; they are a necessary component of transformation.  \n\n\n***8. Self-Compassion and Perseverance***\n\nBe kind and gentle with yourself while you travel the inner journey. It's good to make mistakes or distractions since growth takes time. Every step, no matter how tiny, counts as progress.  \n\n\n***9. Authenticity as a Gift***\n\nThe inner path ultimately brings you to the priceless gift of authenticity. Your ideals, purpose, and genuine self grow more in line with one another.\n\n  \nYou operate from a position of honesty and power inside.  \n\n\nThe inner journey is an ongoing process of self-discovery and development that lasts a lifetime. Moments of self-realization, empowerment, and change occur on this voyage.\n\nSo, dear visitors, may your inner voyage bring you insight, strength, and a closer relationship with the lovely soul within.",

WHY is the radio always on EVERYWHERE you go?\n\n\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude14\n\nreplace this noise with natural, beautiful, balanced and homeopathic energies that soothe your soul as we prepare for the coming weeks and months \ud83c\udf41 namaste",

I'm suffering everyday from this deep pain that feels unending. I feel invisible, no one knows how badly I need support.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd39\u2026I have so much joy, laughter and love to share, but I am alone and feel disconnected from everyone around me\u2026. But it's almost in a comforting way?\u2026 Like even though it hurts, this is how things should be and I need to focus elsewhere, likely inward. What am I meant to do in this lifetime?...\ud83d\udd39\n\n\nI think I\u2019m at a great crossroads in my life. My mind and my physical presence has felt like it\u2019s shifting. I am more curious and mystified by my thoughts of the great beyond and source than I ever have been before. But I'm very stuck. Like I\u2019m so close to a breakthrough that never happens. I\u2019m trying to understand myself and the universe at the same time, with no progress. I feel so confused and I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m looking for. I just know it\u2019s there.\u00a0\n\nI have been dealing with a great amount of emotional turmoil from my relationships and I desperately need healing for the rejuvenation to come back into myself. I often feel empty, isolated & drained of energy + emotion; But I have no one close to understand what I\u2019m going through. This perpetuates my feelings of being lost and left alone to struggle in the confusion. I feel like a fire slowly being put out. But I\u2019m frantic to find some sense of direction and safety before my fire completely goes out.\n\nI don\u2019t have anyone in my life to ask these questions as I am made to feel crazy for wanting to follow this spiritual path. But I deeply want this and long for an understanding of higher knowledge. I want to connect with higher power to help guide me into the person I'm meant to be in this lifetime. I would really benefit from that atm.\n\nI don't think I have ever felt a connection with any spiritual beings, or that my calls to higher power have been answered in a way I could identify. I don\u2019t see entities per se; But I do have dreams nearly every night. Nothing fun and trippy I don't think, I usually cant remember them when I wake up, unless I wake up and sleep again. So I think I'm starting at the bottom as far as intuition loll. But I continue to observe my surroundings all the time for something unnatural and enlightening, in case they're feeling jumpy that day.\u00a0\n\nI want to relearn & get to know myself in order to nurture my soul into bringing light and positivity to everything it touches. I know I am capable of getting back to a happy healthy mindset that would cultivate this. I want to share my love and not let it fade away from the pain I\u2019ve felt from solitude. Nevertheless, I want to connect with something much greater than myself and find purpose, light, love, meaning, peace and happiness (and much more). I know this is my next step & I\u2019ve been putting it off for so long thinking it may find me. I can't wait longer, I need a change. I'm ready to practice and sacrifice for my betterment. I just want to make the right moves and know what I may be missing going into this journey. So, how do I get there?\n\n~ If you were able to bear with me through some of my deepest unspoken thoughts, thank you so very much for reading\u2764\ufe0f. I truly believe I came to the right subreddit with this, and for my first serious Reddit post! I\u2019m so happy to share with this community. I know those I hope to connect with are listening, please don\u2019t hesitate to share any information at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to message me as well! I will be waiting in anticipation. sending love from op \ud83d\udc95~\n\u00a0\n\u00a0",

          "content": "Hello, I want to share that I found a new way to open up chakras but I don't know if this technique will work for other people like it did for me but I'll share it anyway and it's really simple. I was able to talk to my spirit guide by sending them thoughts in my head. I didn't have to go into meditation or any trance state at all. I always thought that opening up my chakras would be difficult for me because I have lived with a very bad diet eating low vibrational foods all my life but I don't think that diet matters for chakra activation now, at least for me. I told my spirit guide telepathically in my head \"please open up my chakras, I am ready now\" and it's very clear that they heard me even though I had no prior relationship with my spirit guide before. The next day after I did this I noticed that my back and head had begun to tingle very intensely throughout the day even at work and in class. I then began seeing spirits much clearer also when I became alone. Prior to this I was only able to see spirits in my peripheral vision but now I can see spirits very clearly since my guide has opened up my chakra channels. The spirit guide looks like a white humanoid figure that I've seen many times in my peripheral vision in the past, I can also see other spirits that have a black form now too. My spirit guide tries to tap on the walls to get my attention and also to answer yes and no questions. The spirit also is able to manipulate technology and it lowers the volume on my TV and it also shuts it off. However I have noticed that my spirit guide kept invading my space. They keep having their energy go into me and they change the temperature of the air around me so that it feels a little colder and the spirit also pokes me on the head and back at times. I can hear small glimpses of its voice and it constantly made my ears ring because it just kept changing it's frequency and it knew I was getting scared of it so it tried to make its voice less scary sounding. I telepathically asked it to stop invading my space yesterday and it has seemed to keep a distance from me now. I had a reading done by a trusted medium and they said that my great, great, great, great grandfather is my spirit guide and that they opened up my chakra channels because I had asked them to and that the spirit simply wants to talk to me and help me on my spiritual path. Is what I did a normal way of opening up my chakras and to also gain spiritual mediumship abilities. Now whenever I think of the word \"spirit\" my head begins to tingle because my guide always thinks that I'm trying to communicate with it even at times when I'm not. Can other people try what I did to see if it works with opening up chakra channels? Also what do people here think of this?",

          "content": "About a month ago, I went through I guess what you could call a midlife crisis. But it seemed more severe than that. Some bad luck kind of shook me into a depressed state, and I kept crying daily with no control. It felt like my actual worldly problems didn't matter much anymore and I just felt so empty. I kept asking myself what the point of anything was and I was actually feeling a bit suicidal. \n\nThis went on for about two weeks and slowly got better. However, it seems to have started my journey towards becoming spiritually awakened. I feel that there has been a massive shift in me, and I still struggle toward the next steps. I do feel a little more hopeful and optimistic. I came across this subreddit and saw some of the things people were saying, and it sort of clicked for me that this is what I'm going through. I believe I was so depressed because I thought that I had basically reached the end of everything that matters. I guess like I've been living in this happy/oblivious snow globe, and I finally got to the outskirts of it. To be honest, I've always felt this way deep down, but I shut it up with over working myself and keeping busy. Now these feelings are coming back up so loud that I cannot ignore them any longer. And to be honest, I don't think I even want to go back to my oblivious, mediocre life. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar. And if you could help me with what next? I read a lot of the posts on here, and I feel like a lot of you are much further along in your journeys that I don't necessarily understand it all. Any guidance would be much appreciated.

I lucid dream a lot but last night I had many vivid dreams (each time I fell back asleep) none of them lucid. The final dream has stuck with me. I was with my daughter (1 year old) and my ex (her dad) whom I have zero romantic feelings for. He was flirting with some girl in a cafe (this is what he's like in rl) so I walked out of the cafe and onto a seafront with my daughter in my arms and a large dog jumped up and bit my daughters neck. The owner ran off as I was shouting to call an ambulance so I ran back to my ex to call one and then I woke up. I've now had anxiety all morning and can't stop thinking about it. What could it mean?",

          "content": "I\u2019ve decided to break of my fwb relationship w my best friend of almost ten years. I (25F) met my best friend (26M) in high school. We were strictly platonic since we both were in relationships. After some time, our relationships had ended. We started having a sexual relationship for about a few months. After those months, we went no contact for nearly two years. He lived his life, I lived mine. We reconnected in 2020 after I asked to speak to him. We were just friends for about a year before we rekindled our sexual relationship. We\u2019ve always had our inconsistencies, so once again we went no contact for a month or two. AGAIN we met back up and stayed solid for just shy of one year. Continuing to have sex. I just felt so comfortable with him. I gained a lot of weight during 2020, and he never made me feel undesirable. In fact, he was even more attracted to me. (I gradually lost some weight over time) During 2022, you guessed it, we went no contact. Four months. Within those 4 months, I met a man (25 at the time) on a dating site and hit it off really well. Good conversation, similar interest, same love for deadpan, dry humor- I just thought he was just so pleasant. I got a chance to click with someone new. That changed everything. Fast forward to October, I see my best friend (let\u2019s call him Harold) at a party. Harold is a DJ, so this was no surprise. We start speaking again in November. We have sex almost immediately. Why am I doing this? Security, predictably, and an itch needed to be so desperately. I also was in love with him. What can I say? He always tried his best to understand me. Never made me feel unwanted. We were best friends. However, I always knew something was not right. It never felt right. But, I always tried to make it work. We have such good chemistry. Just between you and I, he was never able to satisfy me. \u201cSo why did you keep going back?\u201d Like I said, security. Fear out of being with someone new. I was also IN LOVE. Unfortunately, after each romping, I started to grow bored with it. Just in time for dating app dude to say he\u2019s going to be in the area of my city, and he wants to see me. Let\u2019s call him Caleb. After almost a year of us being internet friends with a heavy overlay of sexual tension, we were going to see each other. I had to see him. We met, we talked, we indulged in alcohol, kisses were given, clothes came off and we did exactly what you\u2019re thinking \u2026 and it was fucking great. \u201cSo now what?\u201d Well, that\u2019s it. Caleb went his way, I went mine. Now, after this I went celibate for approximately 4 months. I was not giving Harold sex. I was so uninterested after what I had gotten. During this time, my eyes were starting to open to his and I\u2019s situation. I started to see him differently. He\u2019s quite pessimistic, unlucky, anxious and very unhealed. But this is still my friend. This is my friend that reminds me too much of the bad in myself. And that is precisely the problem. I started to understand that this might be a karmic connection. I found my stagnancy, trauma, fear, laziness being enabled, fueled, and mirrored back to me. Misery loves company, right? On September 3, 2023, my grandparents house caught fire. My grandfather was transported to an advanced hospital to be treated. My grandmother, very unfortunately, didn\u2019t make it. And guess what happened? Harold and I had sex. Maybe I needed to feel comfort and passion. No, it was NOT good. The norm. 12ish seconds. No redemption round. What was I expecting anyway? Two weeks later, we had a minor disagreement. Instead of us talking it out, he stopped speaking to me. Two weeks of nothing. I tried to speak to him. He denied it. Okay, fuck you too then. We laid my grandmother to rest September 25th. This changed my outlook on life. I started observing everything, everyone around me. Then I got angry. My best friend hasn\u2019t even checked on me? A few days ago, I get a text. \u201cI would like to speak to you.\u201d Harold. Demanding. No humility. No \u201chey, i know you\u2019ve seen your grandma for the last time and she\u2019s dead are you okay?\u201d I press and hold the thread. \u201cDelete thread?\u201d It\u2019s gone. All the jokes, emojis, memes, voice notes. Vanished. I\u2019m okay if I never see him again. I don\u2019t care to. I have to break the cycle. Pour into myself. Drop the bad habits that would\u2019ve had company with his. The plant trying to nurture will never grow under his dark cloud. So, I let him go. And I choose me.",

I had a lot of questions after having this experience, all of them I was able to get answers for pretty easily except for one. The experience itself isn\u2019t relevant but the question is. \n\nI was curious on everyone\u2019s opinion of Random Chance or Fate. Whos to say that a major moment in your life was Fate rather than random chance. Are some things meant to happen while others are simply random and if so how could you tell the difference. If something is Fate then why is it or vice versa? \n\nI know this is largely based off of personal beliefs but it\u2019s an interesting question to ponder.",

Recently however I've been seeing them more frequently, idk if it was just the weather or something but it seemed out of the ordinary to me, on top of the dragonflies I was now seeing not being the usual green but a brightish red. I didn't think anything of it. I had pretty good days when I saw them on my ways to work. ( I walk to work) another thing is it feels like whenever I do saw them they always made sure I noticed them.\nLike fly in my path stop and however until I noticed, then after I did would leave. Or even more bizarre is, for me I walk a lot looking at the ground so you'd think I miss them sometimes right? No, they fly in a way where they're shadow would be casted where I'm looking down at then id notice them, and yet again they'd leave after I did. However the most out of the ordinary thing happened the other day, I didn't just see one or two on my way back from my work, I saw like a entire group there was easily over ten to fifteen flying around in this little area on my path. Not annoyingly either they were just there, they also didn't fly away when I noticed them(which tbh even knowing me it would've been hard to miss them) I just didn't really know how to take it then but I thought to ask because it's been sticking with me sense.",

I\u2019ve always been a spiritual person but never had the actually connectedness of the oneness with the universe, and the realization of all the systems in place on earth and how none of it means anything , until after a break up with an abusive drug addicted ex boyfriend of 4 years. \nAt first I was soaring, so free from the break up and freedom of not being yelled at all the time. \nBut as I kept feeling a bit beaten down by not finding any lasting connections with spiritual people (I have made some amazing reaffirming connections but I\u2019m seeking a new best friend and partner with the same or similar concept of life / I know this will come when I\u2019m ready). \nBut between that - constantly being belittled for being a silly hippie \nI just haven\u2019t found the strength to leave my job that my soul is desperately begging me to do. It\u2019s so boring and corrupt (corporate) \nBut the money is good\nSo I just can\u2019t find the strength to let go of the money. \nBut I\u2019m soooo tired everyday/ mentally drained\nAfter work that I just smoke weed. And I\u2019ve become insanely addicted and I smoke every waking hour just to put up with my shit job. \n\nI feel so stuck in life alone, and afraid to make big steps.

Weirder it was pouring raining got to her grave it stopped then the moon was covered with clouds then when my body & soul was relaxed the moon shone through the black clouds.

First time poster here.\n\nI am hoping someone might be able to give me insight on my current situation. \n\nI had a spiritual awakening almost a year ago and have done my own studying/research on spirituality, existence, oneness, the Divine (or whatever you prefer to call it), energy, etc. and recently deeper topics like time, dimensions, quantum mechanics and it\u2019s tie to my beliefs. Although self-study and discovery is great, I am really lacking in the support part of all of this.\n\n I have tried talking to family and friends about my thoughts, experiences and beliefs and just about everyone thinks I\u2019m off my rocker to some extent. I love groups like this and I following a lot of spirituality pages that I feel a sense of community in but I really wish there was an in-person place to go and discuss these things. My friend invited me to her Christian church a few times and I joined for the experience but it doesn\u2019t fit me because I don\u2019t believe exactly what they do. I believe Jesus was a real enlightened person and that the Bible is a book of real experiences (and a lot of metaphors) but it just doesn\u2019t feel right. I have never considered myself \u201creligious\u201d and I\u2019ve never conformed to any religions before. The only religion i ever felt connected to was Buddhism but even then, it just didn\u2019t feel right. \n\nAnyways- here\u2019s the point of my post. Are there groups of people that study this stuff in-person? Is there a \u201cchurch\u201d that encompasses what we believe? I want to connect with people with my same beliefs in a community like people do at church. I want to be taught more from people that know more than me, not just posts online. \n\nI found a church called Unity that is the closest thing to my beliefs that I can find in my area but even then, it\u2019s a little too \u201creligious\u201d for me. \n\nI would appreciate any insight, advice or suggestions. \n\nThank you!!!",

I estimated that I consumed 10-12g of mushrooms. I had done micro dosing often and full 5-7g trips. My friends would get funky colours, patterns moving and all the \u201cnormal\u201d stuff. At first I would get them too but I soon got fractal \u201cwalls\u201d in my vision. Then eventually I saw sacred geometry making up everything in the room. It was faint and I would still be able to comprehend a wall, ceiling, table etc. \n\nThis 10-12g trip was intense\u2026 \nI was hanging out in my backyard with my friend. We were talking and I looked towards the trees. Everything seemed to have a linear pattern. Like we were living in a simulation. I didn\u2019t think much of it and tried to have a good time. Then all of a sudden reality outside became linear 3 dimensional grey with a sacred geometry symbol stacked linear but also moving. I couldn\u2019t see where I was but my friend brought me inside the house. I couldn\u2019t see anything in the room as a \u201cnormal\u201d object. Unless I shook my head back and forth. I didn\u2019t feel scared but I had a feeling like I wasn\u2019t supposed to see this. I kept looking at my friend and saying \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to see this, I shouldn\u2019t be able to see this.\u201d I felt like I was looking into the \u201cfabric of reality\u201d. Finally I came down and felt an overwhelming sense that everything is going to be okay. Mundane things don\u2019t matter and to just enjoy the time I have here. \n\nA few days later I decided to try and find the sacred geometry symbol I saw. I found the dodecahedron which is \u201cdivine ether\u201d. \nI want to know if anyone else has seen what I\u2019ve seen on psychedelics?

For reference, I\u2019ve been listening hemi sync apes for over 6 months \u2013 and can now easily put myself into mind awake body asleep state (Focus 10) even without the tapes. Its such an interesting feeling because you\u2019re in this sort of trance where you feel your body sleeping but your mind is completely awake and active. I even wear a ring that measures sleep and it confirms that my body is in deep sleep. I think this definitely opened me to spirituality and I\u2019ve had many interesting moments since. \n\nAnyway \u2013 When I got to bed last night, I tried to fall asleep but couldn\u2019t \u2013 what proceeded after was about 3 hours of hypnagogic hallucinations, weird vibrations, visions of faces, I went back to some past moments and even thought of myself in 3rd person at times (as if my guide was talking to me like look she is enjoying this state) \u2013 you have to remember this is me going in and out of this state as I was actually tired but ive never had it last for so long. Didn\u2019t do anything weird or unusual before bed so have no idea what took over me \u2013 its like I was spiritually possessed (not in a bad way at all) it was just a lot happening that my rational brain couldn\u2019t explain. My forehead was also vibrating and saw vibrations from where my 3 eye is I guess.\n\nCan anyone explain this? SO STRANGE",

A complete 180 from a year ago.\n\nI just received news that my spirit guide is not content with everything and wants more from me. I was introduced to my guide a year ago during a time of my life when I was very guarded, and was overwhelmed to say the least. Not only had I never heard of a spirit guide, but I found out mine was Aphrodite, a literal goddess, and boy I felt the pressure. She has only communicated to me with words through others, some are friends and others are random strangers, but usually the strangers are her way of sending an SOS and I know at this point, and it hasn\u2019t happened for a while!\n\nI feel her signs, I\u2019ve been open, feeling the love and want to LISTEN more, but don\u2019t know what more I can do. She\u2019s impatient (not my personal words but she actively tells this to others) but I would love to make her proud.\n\nIf anyone has any advice to open up the communication and be more open would be appreciated. Again, I have never felt so in tune and open, so to hear she was not content and impatient for me to get on board today caught me off guard! Any insight would be amazing and I so appreciate you all \ud83d\udc9b\ud83e\udd79",

          "content": "Please hear me out and if this post doesn\u2019t make sense, please let me know so I can try to simplify it.   \n   \nTwenty years ago I had this manic vision wherein Einstein visited me and said \u201ceverything is relative.\u201d  The vision was incredibly clear, and I felt called to interpret what he meant by that.  I didn\u2019t have any education in physics and it wouldn\u2019t really make sense that I should go learn the subject since I have ADD, bipolar, and many symptoms of autism.  So I went rogue and just let fate decide if anything would come of it.   \n   \nI scribbled thousands of notes and graphs trying to give values to things like god and personality and rocks and poetry.   I never gave up, and in the end, I solved the theory of everything.  \n   \nThe turning point was when I questioned whether Einstein had told me \u201cEverything is relative\u201d or if he meant or said \u201cEvery \u2018thing\u2019 is relative.\u201d  Once I started thinking about what defines a \u201cthing,\u201d or object (I use these interchangeably), I realized that nouns are not what they seem.   \n   \nNouns describe a set of characteristics of something or some set of things that someone recognizes as an object (such as a car made up of parts).  I expanded the definition of object to include all possible things with characteristics to leave nothing out (including people and places).    \n   \nNouns are a convenience to human language, but super computers can communicate observations without naming the object, and instead just describing the object\u2019s characteristics, including actions.   So what does this all mean?   \n   \nThe \u201ctheory of every thing\u201d is that every thing shares all the same characteristic bands/spectrums with everything else (\u201cevery thing is relative\u201d along these bands).  As it turns out, \u201cevery thing is also distinct\u201d (can be assigned an identifying label: name or noun) because no things can have the same exact values for each characteristic at a given time.  For example, no two atoms take the same space at the same time.\n   \nWhat is the characteristic band you might wonder?  Basically, there are no adjectives or adverbs that don\u2019t contrast against their opposites.  Hot vs cold.  Empathy vs narcissism.  Hard vs soft.  Further, there are always gradients.  In fact, you don\u2019t need to find a word like \u201cwarm\u201d to show gradience between hot and cold.  You can just say less hot, or less cold, or assign a point scale to temperature.  These gradients form a spectrum and I like to call these spectrums \u201cbands.\u201d   \n   \nSo how is this theory of everything useful?  Well, I\u2019m glad you asked.  All problems and all solutions are objects per my definition, and therefore, they all have these characteristic bands.  You assign a scale to these bands, and identify the value for each \u201crelevant characteristic\u201d of a problem.  That becomes the identification number for the problem.  Then you use math to run variable analysis on the relevant characteristics to create a list of potential solutions.  And then you evaluate the solutions, again, mathematically.  Every possible object is a solution to any problem, but there are a limited number of objects that are a great solution.  A rock is a solution to almost every problem if thrown hard enough (a rock wiped out all the dinosaurs problems, for example).  You are trying to run an analysis that optimizes the solutions.    \n   \nFor people with incredible imaginations, because they have been manic all their lives and live in imaginary Earthsuits (the most mobile and resource preserving of homes) in imaginary Neverlands.. (ok, it might just be me).. we are able to invent anything in our minds as long as we have the knowledge of what the characteristics of the problem are.  Sometimes the solution requires that we add parts or introduce another object into the equation.  To invent, we need to be aware of or formulate those characteristics and potential objects too.   \n    \nThe only way that I believe this theory can be refuted successfully is if someone can come up with a true binary set of adjectives (or other characteristic) where \u201cless of x\u201d or \u201cmore of x\u201d is not possible.  I asked ChatGPT for an example of something that is binary and it said an on and off light switch.  That\u2019s true that the on/off switch has two states.. on or off.  But I can think of two ways that an on-off switch is not binary.    \n   \nFirst, if you are switching the light off, the mechanism is in a state of motion that goes from furthest possible away from off, to closer and closer to off, to off, and then furthest position away from on.  That is a spectrum.  Next, we are talking about light switches.. can you think of a light switch that isn\u2019t limited to two states?  That\u2019s right, a dimmer switch.  Another spectrum.  So in fact, all possible light switches are on a spectrum and the two-state on/off switch is just one of many.  \n    \nThe spiritual awakening is that I believe much more in my imagination and in developing my intuition through this tool, which represents the underlying framework of everything we can perceive.   \n    \nLastly, if you have any science background, you might be saying to yourself, the \u201cgrand unification theory\u201d has nothing to do with all of this.   And, you are mostly correct.  Physicists are searching for a formula that conveys an over-arching calculation for the forces of the universe.  What I have solved is grander because it applies to every subject, not just physics.  Every banded characteristic is it\u2019s own dimension for example.  And there are thousands of known characteristics.  Physicists only recognize 3d space and time.  I\u2019m not here to argue, just to share what Einstein showed me.",

I never really thoughr anything of it because it happend maybe 3 times in 18 years. Then i met a now good friend, which i could feel very well. By that i mean i could feel when he would text me or arrive by my hous. Strange for me but whatever right? It was just an imteressting funny thing that happend to me so i laughed it off. I had a dream of a painting and it felt so real, 2 years later i met my now bestfriend. The painting was in here house. I was so shocked. And then i slept with a coworker of mine, at first it was all perfect but it ended as fast as it started, here my problem.\n\nI began to feel him in my heart, i thought maybe he thinks about me or something but he made clear he didnt like me in that way. Later i learnd that i feel his pain... i feel his heart ache, when he's sad or just down. I talked to him about it and he also laughed it off, he believed it because i knew to much about his pain and the time and date for it to be BS.\n\nAnd the problem is its getting more and more and i don't know what to do with it. Now i feel him in my heart, my stomach, my brain i even feel like sometimes i see how he lays in his bed. And something really strange happend.\nI dreamed about a childhood experience he had. A traumatic one. I asked him because that just couldn't be true... but it was. I saw the futer sometimes yes, but NEVER a memory frome someone else. I wasn't even born when it happend.\n\nMy question is... why do i feel this? Why me? Do i need to help him? Do we belong together? Could it be that he wished for someone to understand him or sth? \nI don't get it and i just wanna know why. Im tired of it.\n\nThank you so much for reading and your help",

          "content": " \n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'd like to discuss my experiences and challenges since embarking on my spiritual awakening journey. It feels like a whole new world has opened up to me, and my perspective on life and the world has drastically changed. Previously, I was always curious and sought out more and more information, particularly about the afterlife. I listened to various spiritual gurus online and read numerous books in search of peace, with a focus on creating the life I desired.\n\nWhile I did achieve some material goals, I found myself dwelling in negativity. My emotions became more intense; for instance, if I felt angry before my spiritual awakening, it was amplified tenfold afterward. I made efforts to shift towards a positive outlook by engaging in good habits like going to the gym, running, and exploring new hobbies, but it seemed like the majority of my feelings were negative. Experiencing glimpses of happiness became rare.\n\n&#x200B;",

I can't seem to understand why things are the way they are anymore, as if I woke up one day and saw society and the way most of us interact, identified a problem with it and can't seem to see things as they were before. It's suffocating, and giving me panic attacks. Some days I'm okay and I question if I'm going crazy. But I seem to revert back to questioning the why, of everything. Has anyone else felt this way, and how long did it last? Was it something you felt everyday, were some days better than others? I seem to be having more bad days than good at this point.",

          "content": "Hi everyone, hope you are all having a good day. This year I have experienced a spiritual awakening (or re-awakening) after quitting my job that was causing me severe burnout. \n\nThis will be a bit of a long post but I hope someone out there will have the energy to stick around. \n\nI was raised in an environment of fear, negativity and very low vibration. I was the oldest so responsible from the age of 4 or 5 for taking care of my mom's extreme anxiety disorder and talking her down from her daily fears for her and our family. My siblings were protected from this side of things, while I was brought in to be her therapist and also mediate the marital issues between my mom and dad. \n\nI know it is part because I am a natural leader and am a smart and quick person. So my mom and parents gravitated towards me since a young child to tell them what to to do in their life emergencies. It taught me to be a leader from a young age, and also be a very powerful empath. I don't know how much was nature versus nurture, but I learned how to perceive people's real emotions, and predict how anyone would act in any situation in order to anticipate these emergencies. This benefited me and led to track record of top grades in university and a track record of always being successful and being promoted \"historically quickly\" in jobs and very rapid career advancement. It it also left me with a lot of unacknowledged trauma. My family is extremely enmeshed. \n\nI always had some connection to the spiritual. By the time I was 7 I would have panic attacks at night about the idea of death. I would also be haunted or visited by spirits. I would hear them walk around bed so distinctly. I had several very inexplicable experiences. I also felt a connection to the divine. It felt like a very distinct memory that I was from the stars. \n\nI surpressed this until this year. My life and career burnout was so extreme that I broke off everything. Quit my career. Cut out toxic friends. Established healthy yet empathetic boundaries with family. I feel happier and more fulfilled and free than ever. I know without a doubt I'm on the right path. \n\nMy spiritual awakening happened after this. I felt my connection with high vibration. Letting go of negative emotions. Being 100% authentic, trying new creative endeavours and following my heart and passion and feeling the connection to source.  I also connected to my grandfather as a spirit guide. It was unexpected. But in retrospect he was very successful and fulfilled and was clearly so connects to source and such a beautiful, quiet, good man. \n\nBUT I have this very profound instinct that my spiritual journey's next step is to physically face the physical manifestation of some type of negative energy, spirit, etc. that has been around me my whole life. I feel myself resisting facing this moment happening from fear. I can just tell something very physical and scary is going to happen to me as my next step. And I am scared I must face it to advance on my path. But I am scared. I'm sleeping with the lights on and avoiding moments of alone in the darkness when I think it will happen. \n\nBut another part of me knows I have to let this happen to move beyond it to this place of abundance and confidence. It is my ultimate battle with fear that I must face to advance. I know fear is a vibration. I know I am meant to do good things and help many others. But I am still scared. \n\nI am just hoping the right person finds this crazy long post and gives me some guidance. Facing some physical manifestation of fear is reactivating all this fear in me I am trying to let go of. \n\nFor anyone who read this. Thank you. I really needed to be heard by some other spirit. And I love you. Because we are both a part of the same source.",

A Joyful Start to Morning Meditation***\n\n  \nSpend a few minutes in meditation in the morning. Locate a peaceful area, shut your eyes, and concentrate on your breathing.\n\n  \n***\u201cMindfulness, clarity, and a sense of serenity are all developed by meditation. It serves as a gentle reminder to begin each day with presence and intention.\u201d***\n\n  \n***2. Count Your Blessings in a Journal of Gratitude***\n\n  \nEvery morning, take a few minutes to write down a few things for which you are thankful. \u201c***Writing in a gratitude diary encourages optimism and redirects your attention to the richness in your life.\u201d***\n\n  \nIt's a lovely way to begin the day with a heart full of gratitude.\n\n  \n***3. Affirmations as Self-Belief Fuel***\n\n  \nRecite affirmations that are in line with your ambitions and goals.\n\n  \n***\u201cThese motivating quotes can increase your self-esteem, alter your perceptions, and create an upbeat mood for the rest of the day.\u201d*** If you believe in your affirmations, others will as well.\n\n  \n***4. Nourish Your Body and Soul with Mindful Eating***\n\n  \n***\u201cAlways eat mindfully, whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Enjoy every bite, focusing on the tastes, textures, and experiences.\u201d***\n\n  \nIn addition to nourishing your body, mindful eating helps you stay in the present.\n\n  \n***5. Earthly Reverence: Nature Connection***\n\n  \nIf you can, spend a little time each day in the outdoors.\n\n  \n***\u201cNature delivers a profound sense of grounding and spiritual connection, whether you're taking a walk in the park, taking care of your garden, or just staring up at the sky.\u201d***\n\n  \n***6. Show kindness by sharing love***\n\n  \nEvery day, carry out a random act of kindness. \u201c***It could be as straightforward as a smile, a nice word, or a little helping hand.\u201d***\n\n  \nKindness not only makes someone else's day better, but it also fills your own spirit with satisfaction.\n\n  \n***7. Evening Reflection: Learn the Lessons of the Day***\n\n  \nSpend some time thinking back on your day before going to sleep. \u201c***What did you discover? What difficulties did you resolve? What are you appreciative of?\u201d***\n\n  \nYou develop an understanding of your experiences and a sense of closure via this exercise.\n\n  \n***8. Calming Down at Night: Get Ready for Serene Sleep***\n\n  \nEstablish a restful bedtime regimen. These rituals let your body and mind know that it's time to relax, whether it's through reading, mild stretching, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n  \n***\u201cFor spiritual development and personal transformation, quality sleep is essential.\u201d***\n\n  \n***9. Self-Compassion: Acknowledge Your Imperfections***\n\n  \n***\u201cPractice self-compassion all day long. When things don't go according to plan, be kind to yourself.\u201d***\n\n  \nRecognize that you are growing and that obstacles are merely chances for learning and improvement.\n\n  \n***10. Plan your path when setting intentions.***\n\n  \nSet a clear intention each morning before you start your day. \u201c***What do you hope to achieve? How would you like to feel?\u201d***\n\n  \nYour actions are guided by your intentions, which keep you focused on your objectives.  \n\n\nThese daily practices are more than just routines; they are effective means of fostering both \u201c***personal*** and ***spiritual development.\u201d***\n\nThey support the development of \u201c***mindfulness***, ***gratitude***, ***self-awareness***, and ***a stronger bond\u201d*** between you and the people and things in your environment.\n\nYou will learn that transformation is a wonderful and ongoing process of self-discovery and growth as you incorporate these practices into your everyday life.",

          "content": "\nMy dear child, today we\u2019re going to talk about people in your life, and how you should treat them in your heart.\n\nLet\u2019s start with family. Think of it in this way, you and your family members are souls who agreed to form a team and support each other for the time on earth. Unlike the \u2018rules\u2019 of society, to bind family members as one unit so that populations would be controlled more easily by governments, that many people choose to accept heartily and follow.\n\nSome of family members have met in past lives and therefore carry karmas, good or bad, in this life. Some of brave souls decided to be born into families which carrying faulty blood lines to heal the lineage, for example maybe many generations joined wars and therefore a heavy energy runs in the family.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to sacrifice your free will for any of your family members or anyone at all to give up on chasing for the life you truly desire. You are the one who is responsible for your own life, not anyone else\u2019s.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to grasp and not letting go of how your family member hurt you, as it will deeply drown you into victim mentality. You agreed to learn lessons with them or from them and some of you, for example females, still choose to be born with feminine energy to help balancing Earth, knowing patriarchy and discrimination she will be facing.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to feel as if you owe them anything, a new family member should be born with blessings and unconditional love from parents, and that they willingly choose to raise you up and nurture you with love.\n\nSadly, there\u2019s still parents on this planet that only see their children as a \u2018annuity plan\u2019. They make children feel guilty by always exaggerating how hard it was to raised them up or how much they have given up on their lives, as if they would lead a successful life or live better without having children.\n\nMy dear child, if you were born in such family, it was never your fault and you need to stop blaming yourself and to see what kind of people you parents truly are, behind the vail of abusing you in the name of \u2018love\u2019.\n\nMy dear child, sometimes we letting go of the past doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it was okay for them to treat you wrongly, but is for you to not being punished by other\u2019s faults. It will only bring you more harm than what you\u2019ve already experienced, don\u2019t allow yourself to keep drowning in darkness and sadness, it\u2019s time for you to step forward and live your life and shine you own beauty.\n\nThere\u2019s so much views on this planet waiting for you to explore, and you were never a \u2018damaged goods\u2019 just because of your experience. You\u2019re a strong and beautiful soul, you\u2019re way beyond those barriers that you are facing right now, you have the ability to heal the traumas and to start a new life and to meet new people who is willing to love you unconditionally.\n\nThere\u2019s a saying on Earth, \u2018life is too short to be wasted\u2019, I\u2019m not completely agree with it since there\u2019s no single day in your life that was wasted. All the experience, positive or negative, lead you to the place you are and shape you into the person you are today. On the soul level you were never truly hurt.\n\nmessage from the archangel ~ Ambassador of Light, channelled  by  SiHeng",

          "content": "I recently got myself a shadow work journal and it completely changed my life. I was going through such an intense dark night of the soul I did not know what to do with myself. I couldn't afford therapy anymore and it wasn't helping anyway. I decided to start journalling and writing my feelings out and that helped a bit.\n\nEventually, I got fed up and decided to buy a journal with guided shadow prompts. The prompts were a bit triggering but it turns out it was exactly what I needed, a safe space to let everything out. It resulted in a lot of tears but for the first time, I felt like I was healing.\n\nAfter about a month of shadow journalling, I woke up one day and everything felt different. I felt like I was no longer fearful because I could see that everything \"outside\" of me was just a reflection of what I was dealing with inside. I learned that while I was trying so hard to stay positive and hold it all together, I wasn't allowing myself to accept fully and heal. I was suppressing my emotions which just made everything worse.\n\nI read too that Eckhart Tolle had his spiritual awakening through acceptance of his pain. I feel like in the spiritual community there is so much pressure to just \"stay positive\" and to \"focus on the good\" but that's just not possible until you accept your present moment. I feel like we have missed half the message and the key to liberation is actually shadow work. \n\nI also feel it's important to find the method of shadow work that works best for you. For me personally, it was journalling and writing things out. For others that may be tonglen meditation, talk therapy, or maybe physical exercise.\n\nYou can just journal in an empty notebook like I used to or you can get a shadow work journal on Amazon (there are many, so be sure to choose the best one for you).\n\nThis is the one that I am currently using: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CHWG9QNT/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CHWG9QNT/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?ie=UTF8&qid=&sr=)\n\nI chose this one because it has exercises and journal prompts, and it was recommended to me by a close friend.\n\nAnyway, I hope this was able to help someone.

Different people and different places.\n\nThing is, I am from Gosport UK and my dreams are always set here. But it\u2019s like a wacky version of the place.\n\nAll the locations are warped versions of the places that exist in real life, whether they are significant to me or not. No matter what the dream is about or who is in it, the places I visit are always exactly the same to the fine details. The house I live in, my old school, college, leisure centre, woodlands, etc. even the routes I have to take are the same in every dream no matter what. Yet those places look absolutely nothing like they do in real life.\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder why I know this place as well as I know my real life hometown. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019ve gone into another dimension because I am fully conscious of the fact I know where I am and I know my way around as well as I do in real waking life despite it looking so warped it\u2019s like something from an acid trip.\n\nI never want to have these dreams but they don\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m living a second life while I\u2019m asleep. It\u2019s as if I am awake.\n\nAlso note that I often see my dead relatives and pets but never see their faces. Not every time but it\u2019s semi frequent.\n\nI can visualise the entire dream version of gosport in my mind as I type this as if I just walked home from there now. It\u2019s fresh in my mind always and I know I will never stop going back there whether I want to or not.\n\nPlease help me I need your thoughts\n\n(Edit: to be clear, I used to have normal dreams until a few years ago. I know these are nothing like what I used to dream and I know how different it is from a normal dream)",

I had a spiritual awakening around the same time and I recognise that I have a lot more space to give to people. My friend and I are each others best friend. \n\nMy friend did a edmr therapy last week and the day after she was emotional and she came by to chill. We ate together and then I started doing the dishes. She was talking and I felt vaguely nauseas at a point where I kinda slowed down doing the dishes and contemplated if I should sit down for a bit. Not even a second later she said: \"fun part about edmr that Ive been nauseas all day\". I was surprised. I told her that I also felt a nauseas just now. I asked her if she felt a small headache behind her ears and she said she also felt pressure there. I could feel what she was feeling. \n\nAre there more people with this experience and what did it mean for you? \n\nThanks for reading. Lots of love and light <3",

After going through this for the better part of 6 months I find myself seeing a lot of spiritual videos on tik tok discussing the different steps and paths through your spiritual awakening. \n\nNow I know that everyone\u2019s journey is different and we shouldn\u2019t rely on what random people are saying online but I guess there\u2019s a little part of me inside that worries that what I went through the last 6 months and all the healing I did, was not actually my dark night but instead just another step leading up to it. Just 2 weeks ago I was still going through this so its still very fresh, knowing I went through this still feels so surreal. \n\nI guess I was just wondering if anyone had any insight they could provide or advice they could give of their own experiences/understanding.",

It was the beginning of my personal and spiritual development, which culminated in short-lived self-realization, liberation, enlightenment and ascension where for my 20th birthday (Jan. 4 2014) as gift from God & Jesus I experienced myself as One with God, where I have became \"I am that I AM\", just so I may have understanding of what it means and how it feels and what it implies to have the Christ Consciousness. By the Grace of God I was given this gift so in the future which is coming soon I may build a school and temple of God through which all the nations of the Earth may come to God by learning, experiencing and becoming One with God, through ASCENSION. The Temple of the 144k will be established in the upcoming years so all the children of the earth can ascend to Eternal Life, where all things will be possible, all miracles will be everyday thing through the Power of Infinite Love of our Maker. If 'sinner' and darkworker like myself could receive such a Great Love from God, so can anyone else, no matter who you are or what you have done in your life, forgive yourself and everyone else for everything you experienced in this lifetime, humble yourselves, and Ask, Seek, Knock!\n\nFor everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it is opened.

I have been witnessing all that has happened in your life, and now is the time for you to step forward into the next level of this healing journey.\n\nMy dear child, when I say stepping forward, it does not necessarily mean that you need to manage to do something remarkably to prove yourself to others. Instead, the next step of your healing process is to go further and look inside of your heart, the part where you don\u2019t show others, and tapping into the blocked energy, to see what\u2019s there waiting for you for a long time. We\u2019re now going to reveal your deepest secrets.\n\nWhat is shadow self? When we experiencing trauma in childhood or past lives, there\u2019s something in your heart that you choose to cover it deep inside, because it may cause you pain to even just think about it. And together these experiences hidden in the shadows is your shadow self.\n\nMy dear child, I know you may have asked many times \u2018Why me?\u2019, you may not yet understand the reason for you to experience the \u2018hardships\u2019 that normal people wouldn\u2019t be facing in their life.\n\nHowever, my dear child, everything that has happened in your life has happened for you with reasons and purposes. When you\u2019re yet to know the blueprint of your life, you may fall deep into believing that you are a victim.\n\nMy dear child, you\u2019re not a victim and those things in your life didn\u2019t happen for making you feel sad or heartbroken. These events help you to hold more compassion, love and empathy. It helps you to understand others, and through which, you expand your consciousness and heart energy.\n\nDon\u2019t run away from the shadow, the harder you try to run away from it, the tighter it will chase after you and influence you. Till you stop running and turning back to hug your shadow self, you will truly know how grand yourself is and that you were never truly wounded on a soul level.\n\nmessage from the archangel ~ Ambassador of Light, channelled  by  SiHeng",

However, are you on the right track to achieve this dream right now?\n\nWhen you only chasing after materialism and forget to connect with your inner wisdom from heart, all you can get is insecurity about unknown future and struggles to survive or even imagining of yourself in a endless competition with others for something empty and vain.\n\nJust like drowning in the ocean, people are just like this before they wakes up spiritually. The more they struggle, the more they are drowned. However, when you can clear your mind and open your heart, you can receive guidance from your higher self and most importantly, have inner peace. Through which, you will stop struggling in the water and then you will surprisingly realise that the water is holding you and now you are floating on the sea surface. The flow will bring you to where you need to go.\n\nmessage from the archangel ~ Ambassador of Light, channelled  by  SiHeng",

I got all wam and bubbly, my body locked up. then it was over. i was breathless. i got up walked in the living room. texted him asking if he was good. next thing i know my body is humming again, i feel this internal bliss almost and see a glowing gold light everywhere i look and i burst out into tears. i started to have all these memories pop up and then relief. i was just a shaking sobbing mess lol. ever since then my mind has been quiet for the first time in 16 years, my body doesn\u2019t hurt the way it use to. i just feel lighter.",

The base levels of religions all appear to be different. As you advance through the levels of religion, they start taking on similar meanings. Religion leads to spirituality and at the level of spirituality you are able to see the how all religions are the same. Religion separates humans into several groups of humans. Spirituality essentially shrinks religion into two groups of humans \"spiritual\" and \"nonspiritual\". \"Enlightenment\" is when you see there is no \"other\", duality vanishes and the is no more separation of anything. If you still see anything as \"other\" then you are still in the \"egoic\" dream of human and are not awake. When you see that there is no \"other\", you see there is nothing you need to do, since there are no \"others\" to save or help. There is no longer any attack, attack can only come from \"other\".",

It was time for me to heal, face hard truths, and release the scars from my child hood, that had been crippling me for years. Once I started to paint again, my heart chakra, and third eye started to open up.\n\nI started to receive an energy that flowed through me, giving me visions, and knowledge that couldn\u2019t have come from the human mind. I also learned that the Ego is one of the biggest downfalls that holds us back, from experiencing pure joy, and peace. \n\nI started to apply the knowledge I received and my whole life changed. I dived into the art world, painting like a madman. I couldn\u2019t stop because it felt so good, and I was releasing negative emotions that had been stored inside me for far too long.\n\nA lot of beautiful things have happened since then.  I met my soul mate and got pregnant, and amazing opportunities have come my way.  Now I operate at a higher consciousness level, spreading truths and God consciousness through my work.\n\nI can\u2019t express how important it is to use the gifts you have already been given from God, and how tapping into them and applying them, can bring the utmost happiness, fulfillment, and purpose to your life. \n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffcTap into your higher self, and Paint Your own Story. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f\n\n Follow me and get inspired today\ud83d\ude42Sign up and stay connected\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nwww.artwithevie.ca",

I also wonder could it have just been some type of childhood dream. But it felt too real to be a dream. I remember I was sitting down in an almost church like setting and what I think was a man with a very calming voice said come with me, he then took me over to what I recall looked like a box and said now look in here or something along them words. It was so long ago that I can\u2019t recall every detail but can anyone tell me why I have this memory and what this could be? Could this be me a memory of me passing away in a past life and god reincarnated me? I also had complications when I was first born and the drs had to do something that was like a spinal tap and there was a chance of me being paralyzed from this surgery thank god I was ok, it was mandatory or I would have had some type of problems my parents always say it was the scariest moment of their life because I was an infant and screaming crying I wonder could this have been the light that I remember seeing maybe the lord telling me it will all be ok I\u2019m just very confused of what this memory that has always been in my head is and wish I knew some type of answer of what this memory could have been it was almost like looking into a big metal box in a church as an infant or maybe passing away in a past life and after that I\u2019m\nNot sure what happened, has anyone else had.

          "content": "# One week Spiritual Recovery Plan\n\nThis is not Buddhism, but the truth of the states of mind we occupy.  Use it as the roadmap.  Jump down to the bottom first and learn the 10 worlds before reading.\n\nThe wetware in the body called the mind is not the real you, even if it malfunctions or is in a state of atrophy. Intermittent fasting, no sugar, improved diet and meditation can restart the engines. Then, **stay in a state of service to others, learning, and realization.** Get out the door and exercise your mind, body and soul.\n\nThe 10 worlds are the wonder nugget of inner engineering you must focus on first. Ego can trap you in the first four worlds and make you think you are worthless. Not true. Just look up above human and focus your awareness there.  Once you do, the mind engages into a resplendent quintessent lumiafarious ether bubble of goodness.\n\nDon't expect a constant warm and gooey feeling, but expect the ever-satisfying work of a farmer cultivating the garden.  You will be required to suffer the hoe, but all the good fruit starts dropping into your being all around you in the form of synchronicity and [unexpected movement inward, outward and upward.](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRichardTalkins/comments/16md0e4/one_spiritual_path_only_in_out_up/)\n\nWatch the wonder wetware come back online in a week of this path. Look below at the 10 worlds. Just maintain a focus on virtue development and learning. The lower 4 worlds will vanish. The upper will restart the light in the mind and lead you to the realized state of being, no matter your outer condition.\n\nIf you needed an explanation for why you feel so lifeless and lonely, this is it.  Stay out of the pit (world 1-4) and migrate into the upper 4 worlds of Heaven, Learning, Realization and Service to others.  It's called reaching to heaven for a reason.  All 10 are states of mind.  Buddha is possible, and as they say, ALL are Buddha.  Your higher nature is entangled into the Human, and 10 / 5 are the same person continually.  Simply discover the truth of this being: **resplendent quintessent lumiafarious ether bubble of goodness.**  There's a reason Buddha is fat and smiling on his seat.\n\nMeditate upon and learn these 10 worlds first. Realize which worlds you most occupy, then flip the narrative of who you are and become the nature of the world you wish to occupy.  True desire is the movement between worlds.  Identity is not the underworld below Human.\n\nThe **carryon** in your in-head storage compartment has the capacity to occupy 10 worlds, and if you occupy the lower four, you will miss the true meaning of heaven above you. If you didn't know already, this is the entire meaning of the Kansas Song, **Carryon My Wayward Son**.\n\n**Whirligig your wonder whiskers here first:**\n\n# 10 Buddha\n\n**9 Bodhisattva - Servant and True Being**\n\n**8 Realization**\n\n**7 Learning**\n\n**6 Heaven**\n\n# 5 Human\n\n**4 Anger**\n\n**3 Animality**\n\n**2 Desire**\n\n**1 Hell**",

The book I am reading is called \"The Game of Life and how to play it.\" \n\nIt is a short, simple and well explained book that answered many of the questions I had when I started my search for spiritual growth. I'm sure you can find it on Amazon.  \n\nI would like to ask those of you who feel they are on the path to spiritual awakening, have you felt like everything is pretty much pointless? Like, we're literally here to learn to be kind to other, to grow and help others grow, and to become better versions of ourselves and evolve. Yet pretty much everything we were taught is a lie! Have a good job, have money, have power, have this, have that, acquire as many things as you can, oh and with social media, we live in such a narcissistic society with a \"look at me\" \"look at my life\" \"look at my vacation spot\" \"look at how successful I am\" syndrome that completely stirs us away from our purpose! \n\nHow do we stay focus, yet motivated while unlearning all the bs we were taught?\n\n**1ReplyShare**  \n",

I didn't protect myself and something negative basically ruined my life because I stupidly (full of my self).told it that I will destroy it,well it destroyed me. So I put it behind me and ignored every sign l told myself non of it was real and I went back to sleep. But now I'm free from drugs and all I have been sober 2 years and I'm now having a spiritual awakening that I can't igmore, I asked the universe foe proof and it did. I had random people telling me things that then happened a few days later and then I went to my local crystal/incense shop looking for a crystal necklace for motivation and said I need none of that because I'm really strong, she then told me what I had been threw (again never met) then she told me that my purpose is to heal and I am a healer she said she could literally feel it beaming from me and had euphoria the whole time I was in the shop!! How exciting guys! Where do I go next?.how do I learn to use my healing abilities andnl would anyone like to be who I practice on for free? \ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc4b",

I chose to get on an anti-androgen medication (not birth control) to deal with acne and hair growth. \n\nMy levels are fine now and there is a decrease in acne and hair growth - not gone completely. I\u2019ve noticed meditation has been off and I do not connect to Spirit as easily as I used to. Used to get consistent downloads and felt awakened. I find myself second guessing my intuition and have been feeling stuck. I\u2019m considering stopping it to get back on path.

          "content": "I wanted to share about love.\n\n \n\nWhat is Love?\n\nA lot of people know of the mentality of love in which describes a way of Love. Free and fun-loving is what some might point towards and living with care and kindness within our lives can be a loving way to live. This is not just a starting point but rather a home for how we want to operate at times. There is also potentially a literal mentality energy in regards to that of love pertaining to the overlapping layers on our head area is sometimes discerned by psychics and things of that nature. There is many other kinds of compositions and machinisms of love but one of the most important I feel is that of the Emotion of Love in which some of us have been able to identify in regards to falling in love. That warm loving feeling in the chest area and heart centre in which is a partial indicator that one is in love.\n\nAn emotion?\n\nThe Emotions that we feel in our Heart Centre and Emotion Area is potentially a stimuli that tells of the spiritual around us. We feel and experience emotions daily which lets us know that we are more than flesh and blood and that we potentially have a soul. It\u2019s one of the things that spiritualists can point towards in a scientific way that can lament upon learning in which you are going through in regards to Spiritual Education. The Science of Anatomy will potentially reveal in the future what spiritualist of today are letting know of in the communities that have emerged partially by way of the connection that the internet has created as well as connectedness of nature. Emotions I feel are part of Nature and that myriads of different informations out there letting know of other kinds of stimuli as well that could potentially be considered nature as well.\n\nWhat exactly is an emotion?\n\nWe experience emotions potentially in multiple kinds of ways but the main way that even the average person on this planet discerns the stimuli of emotions is that of feeling and some might point towards touch in which I feel could be considered but the utilization of the word feeling potentially points as well at times to the multi use that spirit employs in regards to certain words in which we use. Feeling almost laments upon another describer word that we use in which explains another kind of sense we have partially in regards to being able to sense emotions. We feel emotions and potentially touch emotions in a certain kinds of way. Visually how amazing would be if the Spirit World was looking upon Emotions similar to how they view physicals. It speaks of how the different perceptions pertaining to sense and what exactly we are. That there could be life within emotion itself is a possibility I have noticed through my own psychic research, Spiritual Communications and experiences.\n\nWhat kinds of emotions are there?\n\nImagine the composition and colour of physicals and other-dimensional beings impacted upon certain actions. That spiritually we could change colour based upon certain energy promotions in which even the energy promotion compositions themselves could potentially be affected upon the action themselves. Even moods could be impactful in regards to how we sense certain kinds of energies. The colour and composition of emotions being impacted at times in regards to the kinds of emotions we create and the thought that we are creating\n\nWhat exactly does it feel like?\n\nMany different kinds of stimuli. There is a lot of different kinds of feeling associated with kinds of senses that we are able to experience in regards to that of Love. From the breathlessness of fear to the high pitch illumination of Joy, the sorrows of despair to the mourning of sadness. To be able to describe some of these experiences without having to use the literal words in which it is trying to describe can be difficult especially since we use those very words to describe other kinds of things within life. We know it to exist by way of how we experience emotions and it is one of those senses in which has been described and understood in ways in which can seem kind of crazy that we don\u2019t fully know the metaphysics behind emotions especially in regards to how we have approached emotion in regards to the scientific communities. This speaks though of the glitch within the system especially in regards to some equating seemingly lack of proof that we have spirit when it partially lies within emotional research. Even describing some of the emotions that exist to regular folk sparks remembrance and understanding in ways in which let know that emotions exist.\n\nWhat exactly does it affect?\n\nWe as physical beings on this planet experience emotion to a certain degree as to acknowledge it\u2019s existence but what exactly is it? Analyze the emotions in which you feel daily and you may become more aware of the truth that exists behind those emotions. I have come to the believing factors that there is life within emotion through my own experiences. That the emotions that we create impact other kinds of spiritual entities behind the scenes in ways in which would make us pay more attention to our emotions. Affecting relationships and mentality, behaviour and personality upon emotional utilization. For some it might affect the setting and interaction in regards to ourselves. Again, seen within Near Death Experience tells of how in certain dimensional existence they can feel emotions to a heightened degree. The imaginings of being able to feel some of our emotions to such a degree especially the negative ones can give one a clue to the kinds of affect it can have on spiritual entities within radius of some of those emotions. For some realms the emotional climate of person might be weather patterns seen in the sky. It\u2019s makes one think about when we look up at the skies and the kind of weather systems we a re experiencing could be the mood atmospherics of the planet. Either way emotions affect many different things and it\u2019s not just in a visual sort of way but just as how we perceive emotions to be in an extra sensory sort way knocks upon the door that there are many different kinds of senses in which some spirits are perceiving emotions.\n\nIs there a difference between feeling emotion and creating it?\n\nYes, although just because we feel emotions throughout our life doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t creating those emotions as well by way of different spiritual mechanics. There is discernible difference though upon creating emotions and feeling emotions. Throughout our life we feel emotions naturally based upon certain situations in which can feel to be less of a willful endeavour in which behind the scenes spiritually it might very well be a willful endeavour. With that being said there is real emotion mechanisms that we can utilize to create emotions daily at will on our end. When you compare the stimuli of feeling emotions and creating emotions there is at least on the onset a difference. Imagine someone moving your leg in which in how it is experienced make you feel like your moving your own leg. Certain spiritual mechanisms being revealed to understand the difference between moving your own leg and someone moving your own leg. It might seem strange but understanding how Channeling works from the spirit can be equated to this example that spiritual entities are working through our own movements at times and that ability to be able to sense that. The same could be said about emotional implantation in regards to the emotions that we feel and being able to discern the difference between spiritual influencing and that of our own emotions as well as understanding the difference between feeling emotions and creating emotions. There are literal mechanisms of emotion in which one can use to create emotions. At times we haven\u2019t been able to fully feel these mechanisms. It\u2019s a tell of some of the lack of awareness in regards to our own spiritual emotional mechanisms. That we could go through life without fully being aware of a communication and sense that we could utilize daily that we have put on the back seat and labelled something that we feel at times instead of something that we can utilize partially by way of our interaction in regards to such a concept of emotions. It would be as if certain spirit channeled through our out loud voice and mind voice at times in which we labelled as something we are able to discern at times rather than be able to use daily as we often do in life. It\u2019s the subtle view in regards to emotions that laments upon something so as strange and obvious in regards to the fact that we are as passive as we have been in regards to our emotions. Partially has to do with understanding emotion and also speaks of the need to put more resources in regards to researching our own emotions.\n\nHow do you create Love?\n\nI learned from certain meditational techniques to be able to invoke the emotion of love where I then was able to understand the methods of emotional creation. As a psychic I am able to feel certain spiritual mechanisms that certain normal people might not be able to fully feel but regular people do know that emotion exists by way of feeling emotions daily. Being able to emulate the emotions you feel at times by way of emotional creation is a part of the learning. I learned from a spiritualist that explained these methods in what he called HCR that being Heart Chakra Radiance or Heart Radiance. White Light visualization techniques in which lent towards learning how to love. That would eventually lead towards the ability of being able to create one of the most wonderful emotions daily.\n\nHow does Love help you Spiritually?\n\nWhat if I was to tell you that we could create emotions through willful energy promotions and help Spirits behind the scenes in multiple kinds of capacities. That there is an actual emotion of love in which you can create that can be beneficial to your spiritual life through direct and indirect means. The radiance of loving energy creates bonds and connection in which furthers relationship in multiple regard and some of it might just be based off of the experience itself. Remember that some of the beings that utilize love might only be able to sense love through the feeling of emotion similar to how physical humans on this physical planet Earth mainly sense love. You can see the power within that and the emotion itself and the kind of impact that can have. There are spirits out there that base how it helps them simply by way of how it feels. The loving radiance can strengthen one karmically by way of how the light judges that action to be moral as well as the kind of energy projected. Raising karmic vibration as well as potentially others in the spirit world. Some of this is partially based of the parameters in how we want the love to affect us and some of which might be set up pre-incarnation and situated by Main Spirit Guides. In the spirit our Anatomy might very well be strengthened by way of loving daily. Think of weight lifting as a metaphor, that when we lift weights and exercise some of our anatomy is affected in certain ways in which can lend towards health. By way of Loving daily we increase and protect our spiritual Health. Think about being able to incarnate from our dimensional live into another existence and that within that existence we could pump iron in which would strengthen ourselves but at a pace where wouldn\u2019t need to lift weights as much as we would have in the pre-incarnate dimensions partially by way of the science of the dimensional existences. This is partially why Incarnation is miraculous and amazing and the metaphor in regards to weight lifting potentially can be said about loving daily while incarnate in which creates a lot positive karma and spiritual health by way of karmic science. We can utilize this to streamline our Karma progression by way of being incarnate and promoting Morality and other kinds of energy promotions.\n\nWhy do we gain Karma from Loving Daily?\n\nThere are many different kinds of layers to the Spirit Realm. In different dimensional existences there are different kinds of energy promotions in which literally strengthens our spiritual bodies by way of energy promotions. There is a baseline in regards to some of those Dimensional Existences in which points towards ethical alignment increasing Spiritual Frequency and vibration. Think of the Light seen in Near Death Experience Research as one of the Heavenly Existences that some of us traverse after death in which potentially exists around us while we live our life. There are many psychics that point towards Heaven being on Earth and one of the interpretations is a literal in that one of the overlaps around us is the Light and another speaks that we are of condensed light by way of physical dimensional science. The Light has been described in many ways from a Non-Living Higher Power to a Living Dimensional Setting with Personality but regardless we can utilize the Light to let know of certain kinds of Variables that can affect our karmic. This Karma might affect all manner of things in the Light. Think of the Light to also be a place in which is reported in the NDE Accounts in which within the Light there are different layers in which I have learned to call Plane Levels. These Plane Levels to some might look like different surfaces in which we can Traverse. Imagine being able to see multiple kinds of surfaces to the Earth where different Continents exist and potentially different kinds of peoples. For simplistic purposes imagine the light as a Cylinder beam of Light, in which there are many different levels within that Cylinder of Light. Our spiritual Anatomy potentially tethered to that Light by way of being Spiritual Entities of the Light. The God Spark is spoken of in multiple kinds of Spiritualist writings and regardless of how we were created there is multiple kinds of information in which point towards a large portion of All That Is being of the Light, some of which in a literal way. Karmic Vibration, Karmic Level and Karmic Frequency being reflected by the colour of our Light and other kinds in which points towards the Highest Point within the Light that we can ascend often called a Nexus Point. That Nexus Point reflecting our soul colour by way of karmic tethering to the plane level represented in the Highest Point within the Light that we can ascend. The Light Considers Loving to be a Moral Act and when we Love the Light allocates karma in regards to ourselves which increases our vibration, frequency and karma which also increase our access within the Light to Higher Plane levels and is reflected by our Karmic Colour.\n\nHow does our Karmic Colours Correspond with Karmic Levels?\n\nThink of those Plane Levels within the Light to be of different kinds of Coloured Light. I learned from one of my Spiritual Teachers certain kinds of Karmic Paradigms to exist within the Light. Different kinds of coloured levels of Light in which I adapted based off of Communication and subtle signs within the physical Itself. The physical Colour Spectrum being one of those tells in regards to which Karmic Colour corresponded with different plane level existences.\n\nAt a young age I was able to see dots of light in which I would find out are potentially interacting with me from the Spirit World. These dots of Light I was told and would confirm with psychic communication were potentially the Karmic Colours of Spiritual Entities in which I was able to see, it was one of the first psychcitivty that manifested. These Karmic Colours being representative in regards to the Highest Point within Light that they could ascend. Another subtle tell would that of the prism rainbow which speaks of the power of shapes. Which can reveal rainbows within light naturally in the physical. There is a spiritual metaphor regarding this pertaining to certain light existences afterlife. Entire surfaces of coloured Light located within certain Light Dimensional setting.\n\nWhat can you do being located at Higher Levels of Light?\n\nAs you increase in Frequency, Vibration and Karma you become more powerful as your God Spark and Soul grows and strengthens from Higher Light Access. A simplistic way of looking at certain kinds of Karmic levels is equating it to video game levels that as you promote Morality and Love you increase in levels in which your powers strengthen as you move to Higher levels. Larger utilization of Light in regards to Creation is another possibility of the benefits of moving upwards in frequency. Access to different kinds of cities of Light and information located above. Abilities Manifesting as you reach those levels of Light in ways in which can help you in Daily Spiritual Life. This lending towards the theory of God-Realization through morality promotion, love and other kinds of energy creation.\n\nGod-Realization Theory?\n\nDo note that this is a theory and I would still pursue the methods described in regards to Heart Radiance pertaining to Learning to Love regardless of what you believe in. Many understand the feelings of emotion and even the baseline feeling that you can create daily in regards to Love can be beneficial. There is an idea that the creator split himself to create many different kinds of spirits at lower karmic thresholds in which lends towards the God spark theories found in spiritualist writings on this planet. It also explains why there has not been more large scale miracles located on this planet and elsewhere at times in regards to the hypothesis that God potentially did not survive the split but there are also other theories as to why certain kinds of spiritual intervention has not yet happened similar to that of the Prime Directive which still lends to the idea that God has very much survived. There is a Theory that explains that certain kinds of Gods have yet to emerge to that original Karmic Level of the original Creator when he split up. Upon reaching those Kamric levels, certain spirits reaching to the karmic level of what some would equate to being Gods, would be able to emerge in the physical and harness the power obtained to promote larger acts of Morality like heal the sick on this planet in an instant and create large-scale manifestations of food and water for those in need. This idea that we could love daily while incarnate and streamline karmic progression where upon we eventually could be considered what some would consider to be Gods. Imagine passing on to the next place and through the act of love achieving God-Realization in certain dimensional existences.\n\nWhat is the Importance of Love?\n\nIt is described in many different sources and seen within many different writings. Experiences beyond in many different kinds of afterlife described where the feelings described let know of extra sensory ability extends beyond what we are able to discern at times while incarnate. Let knows of the importance of the creation of love is consistent so much so that it has seeped into our own society in it\u2019s own way as an underlying subconscious in which is partially based upon the spiritual understanding of just how important the endeavour of Love can be. It\u2019s more than just being able to traverse plane levels while incarnate and streamlining progression to that of Godship. The emotion encapsulates a secret that has been lost in some places in which at times certain spiritual communities have understood. The essence of what we are and one of the abilities to be able to express this.\n\nWhy does the Light consider Loving to be Moral?\n\nThe Light can discern Moral actions in more advanced ways than some of us discern morality to be. There is a gauge in regards to what we consider morality to be and what actions would be considered moral in which potentially stems from what the Light considered to be ethical. You can ask the average person as to whether they felt love to be a Moral action and the response will be heavily in favour of it being a Moral action for a reason. The moral Compass Gauges it to be that partially by way of societal perception in which is potentially based off of the Original Light ethical discernment. When coupled with the actual action and the feelings it can create, the connection and essence of what we are and used to be exists within the act of Loving. This creates a karmic gain upon the act itself. Our Societal Ethical Compass in what we understand to be Moral is a fairly good gauge in what the Light would consider to be Moral. There is a literal science in regards to how the Light understands Morality in which is Systemically Ancient.\n\nWhy does Society not fully understand these secrets of Love?\n\nThere is a reason why Love is considered to be secret to life. It\u2019s espoused in many different ways throughout spiritualist writings and Near Death Accounts that this is the case. Even in a mainstream way, Love is an underlying current that some are aware of and the concept exists in many kinds of forms in which societal awareness and understanding can grasp in certain ways. The key in regards to that awareness lies within falling in Love and what exactly that entails. Heart Song. Heart feelings in which leads someone to claim at times they are in Love is one of the specifics in which Heart Radiance exists within the context of what society understands love to be. The difficulty is that at times in regards to identifying that Love as a Real emotion in which can be utilized daily is that it has been turned into symbol where the knowledge of loving emotional radiance has been hidden. The great thing about it though is that it is a great positive to have such an interest in such a concept in which brings peripheral understanding and context in trying to explain what exactly Love is. It\u2019s not a concept as a psychic-medium that I would have to explain into detail as there already is perceptual understanding. There are many different kinds of Acts of Love but one of the ones I am espousing is in regards to literal emotional creation. It extend beyond though in many different capacities as I would find out.\n\nHow Exactly is literal Love going to Help me though?\n\nIt can create an environment around you spiritually where like minded spirits traverse to your process in which positively impact your life and lives of others. There are those in the spirit realm that benefit from love creation daily. It strengthens bonds and relationships and the invoking of Love and help in regards to the creation can be considered to be a moral endeavour. It helps create positive karma and can create higher light access in which can be utilize to create good. Potentially gaining access to new areas within the light and advanced abilities manifestation. It can lead towards greater emotional awareness and I feel it is a decent path towards becoming psychic and empathic should you want to pursue that endeavour. Spiritual Guideships know what you want as they can ask you spiritually in multiple kinds of ways without having to ask the you dimensional live self in a certain context. It strengthens certain setting and environment at times by way of utilizing love daily. The area around oneself benefits form utilizing love daily and can create positive effects as well as natural defense from certain negative spiritual entities. Literal boundaries set by way one emotionally presents oneself can lend towards the atmospherics of a process being impacted although there are spiritual teams that can help in regards to the negative of this understanding. It\u2019s not just helping you though it\u2019s also helping some of your spirit teams and guideship as well as those that you love towards.\n\nThe importance of love within the confines of spiritual development cannot be overstated. It is one of the keys to the secrets of life. Loving from your heart centre is very much a needed endeavour in today\u2019s world in which can help the Spirit World in many different kinds of ways. One of the key things that I want you to take away from the Methods listed in regards to Heart Radiance is to continue to try using the methods until you can discern Loving Emotions and understand that ability to Create Emotions.\n\nI learned methods on how to love from a teacher of mine called Avadar at a young age. I had been able to discern spiritual colours in which upon searching the Internet as to answers as to what exactly I was viewing, I found an answer in which struck a chord within myself that let know that the colours I was viewing was potentially thar Karmic Spiritual Colour of Spiritual Entities around myself. He developed certain Teaching earlier on in his life in the late eighties and early nineties in which has been refined today in how to love.\n\nI believe these teachings have been taught before through various metaphysical teachers in the past not only within the confines of this physical earth but also on other planets within different dimensions. Where the power of love manifested through the layers upon layers of life to uplift generations and inspire the awareness of those touched by the lover. Some of these teachings on our planet may have been lost to time over the years only to reemerge within certain timeframes but some of it might have survived and certainly have been relearned to reveal these teachings today.\n\nLove is powerful enough though to break through the collective consciousness in many different kinds ways, potentially the Spirit Realm giving us hints and clues as to one of the sacred things in life. Our experiences also give credence to some of the perceptions in which has emerged. The act of love itself has existed for near close to forever and relationships and bond created through those acts potentially remain to this day. It\u2019s augmented by the information coming out of the various psychic and spiritualist research happening today and in the past. Near Death Experience Research is one of those fields and just based off of scanning some of the Accounts I can say that there is let know of love and experiences of love within them in which points towards love being a secret to life in which in the Spirit Realm might not be as much of secret as it is on this Physical Earth Based Culture. Even within the Culture itself Love shines through into pop culture and societal perception in which is partially based off of the act of Falling in love. For some of those acts heart feelings manifest naturally and radiance amplified partially by way of the Spirit Around us. In which we can emulate in certain ways to be able to facilitate the emotion of Love daily.\n\nMy Teacher had labelled the Methods and Modes in which he came up with down here as Heart Chakra Radiance. HCR for short. I sometimes refer to it as Heart Radiance as I would discern a difference in regards to the Heart Chakra and that of the Emotion Centers within our Spiritual Bodies. Either way what we are ultimately referring to for the most part is that of love.\n\nThe point of these Heart Radiance Methods is to learn how to love but you could certainly apply the methods in regards to other types of emotions and energies. The Modes of heart radiance are there to eventually allow someone to be able to love at will without visualizations, meditations, and/or intimacy. Where you would be able to create the emotion of love at will through the action of wilful projection and creation of Love from the Heart Center and potentially from other areas as well. Where you would reach a point in your practice where you would be able to send love from the emotional body and centre at will and to then be able to use the actual emotion throughout everyday life.\n\nThe following are the methods of Heart Chakra Radiance(HCR). They were developed from my teacher Avadar early on in his life.\n\n\u201cMode 1: While breathing normally, visualize a sphere of white energy in your chest, or more specifically, in your Heart Chakra \u2013 the most important chakra for spiritual growth. Then, without holding your breath, visualize radiating white light out of this sphere in every direction at once. It is suggested that one first use this technique in light\n\n(alpha) meditation in order to become accustomed to it.\n\nMode 2: While visualizing Mode 1, program yourself simply through desire to radiate those aspects of spiritual white light \u2013 called Programmed White Light \u2013 that would help you grow in the fastest possible way. Once you start doing this, the improvement is immediate and requires no new concentrated effort; you improve as you use it.\n\nMode 3: This is a natural evolution from the previous modes. Through the application of mode 2 it is eventually realized when the will alone is sufficient to radiate: visualizing is no longer necessary because a certain degree of proficiency has been developed.\n\nMode 4: Because of the difficulty in visualizing this, this mode is not recommended until Mode 3 is performed fairly easily. With the Heart Chakra being the primary focus, radiate as you would from Mode 2 with all of the seven major chakras \u2013 all at the same time.\u201d",
