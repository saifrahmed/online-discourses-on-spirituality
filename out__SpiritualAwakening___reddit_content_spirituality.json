There are spiritual practices that help on this human journey but one cannot trancend being a Human while having a Human Experience. There is no thing to achieve this constant Belief that one must act a certain way because they are \"spiritual\" or follow more norms as if society didn't have enough already. \" you cant get angry you're spiritual\" \"you cant act that way\" this type of mentality causes more harm than good to you.  it's your own mind narrating a story making you believe you have to be a certain way or you're not spiritual. one collective consciousness experiencing itself thru different life forms, there is no manual, there is no set way. Don't let the mind box you in & fill you with spiritual  labels and behaviors.",

          "content": "\nHi guys, I\u2019ll be posting this on multiple pages as I\u2019m a bit confused right now. Bare with this being long, I\u2019m seeking some guidance. After months of reading through, I pushed myself to type this out. A strong urge made me. Maybe someone out here is meant to guide me. \n\nIt\u2019s been 6 months since i separated from my partner of 8 years. We were extremely happy and he had proposed in December of last year. We were engaged for 6 months set to be married this December. \nBut I had been feeling extremely burdened by a secret i was extremely ashamed to share. I kept it with me for 8 years thinking I\u2019d tell him someday but could never gather the courage. But it was not something i hid just from him, i hid it even from my dad who was always my hero. Although i was doing well and landed a job, i had an issue with my college degree which I couldn\u2019t complete. Story has many layers but to keep it short, I tried a few ways to get it sorted legally but it was not working out. (I\u2019ve always been extremely scared of doing wrong things)\nOver the years of keeping it locked in my heart, I could not face god, I kept saying I\u2019m a liar I don\u2019t deserve to pray and would always pray for my fianc\u00e9, dad, family and dogs. Never for myself: \nI was so scared of admitting the truth that I\u2019d even thought of suicide although I knew it\u2019s wrong and cowardly.\nI would always feel like I was being controlled. \nAnother thing to note would be that my dad is a kidney patient who has had 2 transplants and I was getting tested last year as a potential donor.\nSo when I finally decided to come clean, I did not want to burden my already sick dad.\nMy fianc\u00e9 was my home. The kind of love everyone would bet on. I can\u2019t put into words how much I loved him and he loved me. We were in a long distance for 6 years and whenever I\u2019d go see him and we\u2019d  hug, that\u2019s when I\u2019d finally be at peace. It would feel like my soul is recharging and finally happy. \nI could not bear the thought of starting a new phase with a lie. \nI came clean to him and initially he was shocked, he cried, but told me we\u2019d be okay.\nAnd suddenly after 2 days he broke the engagement off, called me a liar and undeserving of anything genuine. \nI was ashamed. \nHis family sent someone over literally a day after we broke up on my birthday to collect the ring. \nAnd somehow my reaction to this was to shut myself off completely. I deleted all of social media accounts. I haven\u2019t been in contact with any family or friends. My heart just sinks. But I know who truly reached out and when I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll do anything to make it up to them. Just right now my mental frame wants me to be alone. \nFirst few days after breaking up,  I couldn\u2019t breathe, I cried, but I got myself back up. In the beginning I kept telling myself I deserved it. I had conditioned my brain out of guilt to think so. It\u2019s changed now. I\u2019ve learnt a lot about affirmations. \nI kept telling him I know he\u2019d leave me because I lied but I also trusted him with my secret before even trusting my dad. He\u2019d always told me I\u2019m family and would never leave me. So I somewhere thought he\u2019d hold my hand and tell me it would be okay. I thought he\u2019d take a break at the max. But I understand it\u2019s his journey and had to do that for whatever it is that he has to discover individually. I don\u2019t even know if i deserve to feel bad. I did not leave my home for months. \nAnother thing was that 2 legit family astrologers( his and mine) told our family that it\u2019s a past life connection and that we couldn\u2019t marry in our previous life is why nothing can stop us from getting married in this life. Exact words. And that kind of made sense to me because with him, I felt home, like I\u2019d always known him. We fell in love so organically. \nEven after our breakup, my mom who is a medium\nSpoke to a few tarot experts and all of them somehow said the same thing about a past life without my mom mentioning it. Somehow a piece of information I never intended to know. \nBut the past 6 months have been a spiritual awakening. \nAnother very important incident is that I lost my baby pug 1.5 years ago. I had always heard of an incident since I was a kid that my granddad and dad would see black butterflies before or after someone\u2019s death in our family. \nJust after the heartbreaking death of my baby ( she was truly something else, the connection felt more that of a normal pet always) which shocking happened of a kidney disease out of all the things ( cause of my dad\u2019s heath), just the morning after her death, 2 black butterflies hovered around me and guided me to her grave and sat on me for a long time. I thought it was my baby\u2019s soul. \nAnd since then it\u2019s been crazy how I\u2019ve seen those exact same butterflies pass by me, sit on me, distract me at different places. ( once when my dad was in the ICU) almost everyday. \nAlso the repeating numbers. I would see all of them everyday for months. 111, 222, 333, 444, 555. \nI also started my meditation and would always see a blue light. \nI then decided to do reiki and finding your animal spirit guide. \nIn the spirit guide meditation, the blue light turned into a butterfly confirming to my reiki mam that butterflies are infact my spirit guide and come to protect and bless me. \nBut that was about it.\nNo other information.\nIt somehow feels like there\u2019s more. I see it everyday, even in my dreams. \nI\u2019ve been not feeling at home. At peace. \nI want to dive deeper into my spiritual practice but don\u2019t know where to begin still battling my emotions. \nAlso, I\u2019m being pressured by family to see other boys and although I know my love won\u2019t come back but in my heart, I have a feeling of unfinished business. How is it fair to talk to someone else when my heart belongs to him? In my core, I feel like that can\u2019t be it.\nWe spoke for a week after I told him everything after which we\u2019ve been no contact. \nI\u2019m just not at peace.\nEvery time I feel I\u2019m okay, feelings hit me again. All my energy goes into pulling myself back up. We\nI feel like the past life stuff in my subconscious is not letting me fully move on. \nAnd I know my energy is still connected to him. \nDon\u2019t know how to navigate this.\nI don\u2019t feel at peace at all.\nI have a strong urge to just leave everything and live in a spiritual center and just pray and serve. \nAnd sometimes it gets dark and I think how it would be to just leave it all. \nThe butterflies, the past life information, the numbers, these feelings. \nI want guidance from a psychic healer or a medium who could guide me but I just can\u2019t find one. I know you don\u2019t just find them like that. \nEven my reiki healer I found with great difficulty and that\u2019s all there was with her.\nWhat\u2019s happening with me? \nI don\u2019t know what to do. \nAll I know is I\u2019m not okay and am not where I\u2019m supposed to be.",

I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO BUT IM PARALYZED ON TAKING ACTION TO BETTER MYSELF. DURING THIS TESTING TIME I BEEN AWAKING A-LOT SPIRITUALLY ON A DEEPER LEVEL AND REALIZING WHAT I NEED TO DO TO REACH MY FULL POTENTIAL. I need to FACE MY FEARS AND HAVE STRONGER  FAITH. I REALLY ONLY FEEL ALIGNED WITH MY HIGHERSELF WHEN OFF ADDERALL AND SPIRTUALLY AWAKEN AND CONNECT THE DOTS OFF ADDERALL. I BUILT ALOT OF FALSE BELIFS ALONG THE WAY. I RECENTLY WENT THROUGH A MIRACLE EVENT THAT I MANIFESTED AND IT SPARKED A LITTLE FIRE IN ME. I NOW FEEL A LITTLE MORE CONNECTION WITH MY FAITH. Moral of the story is that. I feel like I just need take this big leap of faith and jump. Quit my job and have a fresh start. I feel like I attached my bad habits to this job to. So if I quit I will stop my self sabotage.

I Have Yet to Hear From Our Government. They Opened Session Seeking More Info and They Have Yet to Receive Anything or be in Contact w/ Me. They Are Ignoring Me.\n\nThe Day I Found This Was Really Strange. I Was Sent to it. It Was Not Found At My Feet. I Just Knew Where it Was. Not Where I Was Standing but About 50 Yards to the Left Side of the House and Near Mid Stairs I Believe. I Stepped Outside the Door Stood There Staring into the Sky and Something Guided Me Straight to it! Immediately Took Pictures Posted it On Facebook, Twitter and Tagged Many People and Organizations. Nobody Responded. Upon My Own Research I Was At Least Able To Verify its Origins. Belonging to India. Now I KNOW They Are Spiritual but I Have No Ties to This Country or its People. I Haven't Even Visited This Place Before So I Know They Didn't Do It Either.\n\nIt's Something Bigger but What or Who is it? I Believe in Aliens But I Do Not Believe it's Another Being w/ Big Eyes and a Funny Shaped Head. Maybe its a Disguise From Our Spiritual World When Things Aren't Going to Their Expectations or When Courosity Arrives. That to Me is More Believable! I am Spiritual as in I Believe With All My Might and Respect the Source But I am No Where Near One Sidded Nor Do I Plan On Making a Decision of Siding Chosing One Over the Other. Got a Whole Lot of Righteousness and a Pretty Much Even Being Demonic. Strange Things Have Happened to Me Since Around Age 14 But Until Recent Events I Did Not Know What it Was. I Kept This To Myself. All I Know is Both Christ and the Devil Are Very Real and They Do Exist Among Us.  I Have Witnessed Both! I Can't Comprehend the Two Being Together for I Always Believed in Heaven or He'll. Not Together?! \n\nI Was Being Harrased Dealing w/ Some Not So Pleasant People Claiming to be the Government When I Found This, But They Are Not! I Do Believe They Have Ties w/ Government Though. Jealous Over My Demonic Events and They Thought the Mineral  Was Worth $$ or THEY Could Get the Attention From Hollywood's Elite. Come to Find Out it's Only Worth Around $200. It Means A Lot More to Me Than That. With an a Event Like Such One Wouldn't One Assume Protections From Our Government? Not What I Just Dealt With. I've Been in Limbo About the Details On What Just Happened to Me and Sadly I Do Not Have a Specific Answer. The Government Does! They Are Withholding Truths That Lie Behind This. They Have Been Throwing All Kinds of Surveillance On That Stuff For Decades Now. I Know That They Know. They Have Equipment That Finds The Energy Source. \n\nNow If This is as Spiritual As I Think it is Then Why the Silent Treatment? More Jealousy? We All Should Be Estatic Over This Find and to Be Ignoring Such an Event, How Could They Be So Deaf, So Blind and Still Believe That This is OK? I Wouldn't Be That Dumb. That Stuff is Too Real and Way Too Powerful For Anyone To Be Making Decisions Above What's Really Going On. An Indication to Join Forces? AND This Happened to Me? Definitely Not OK. I Deserve to Know What This is About. It's Obviously a Powerful Message Even if I am a \"Just a Girl From Preston County\" I Think That Mineral Speaks A Completely Different Message. It Just Don't Have Anything to Do w/ You. \n\nI Sense This As a Communication Tool and \"a Gift of Gratitude\" Why Am I the Only One Trying to Communicate? \n\nIf it is Indeed Aliens They Can Come Get Me Any Time Now. I'm Ready to Go. I Keep Asking But Nothing Ever Shows Up or Responds to Me. Maybe I'm Suppose to Be the First Person to Truly Communicate w/ Our Friends. I Would Be the One! Not Intimidated At All! Even if I Knew My Chances Might Not Be So Great of a Successful Meeting. Some of That Stuff is Scary and I Mean Scary! Even if It's Not Trying to Harm You Will Scare You! That's What I See is Happening w/ the Government. They Are Geeked Out Over This and It's Funny! They Just HAD to Be Nosey Right?! It's Not Our Place to Monitor its Behavior Though. We Are Not the Higher Power.",

I\u2019ve lost my own perspective to entertain the perspectives of those around me. I switch between not wanting to have a distinct persona and knowing that in order to survive in this reality, I need at least a thin veil of one. I\u2019ve unlocked my subconscious, seeing all that I am, am not, all that I could\u2019ve been and could be, but what do you do with this information? I guess I continue as a soul, my true self, hoping to meet others who also see through the illusions that help ground us into these human bodies. I think that a high degree of intelligence can be indistinguishable from madness. I can understand why the life of a fool is a desirable path as ignorance is bliss. I sometimes don\u2019t want the level of awareness that I possess but the duration of time that I purposefully dimmed my light has only set me back. I don\u2019t know the purpose of this post and I truly don\u2019t know the purpose of life. But I\u2019ll push forward while attempting to accept and truly experience every moment, every sensation, every bit of knowledge, bliss or pain the universe grants me.",

Which I know is paradoxical to say because I\u2019m living a human life in this very moment. I\u2019m torn between wanting everything and wanting nothing. This life has been very good to me. I can tell my ancestors/past lives/whatever put in the WORK\u2026 like oof I do not want to imagine the suffering that they (and you guys) had to go through for me to be able to spend hours in bed just thinking and petting my dog. I was born with a lot of wisdom and life sort of just comes naturally to me. Obviously I\u2019ve suffered, but I\u2019ve never been engulfed by the darkness, only just glimpsed it (so far- I\u2019m young, I know it will come eventually but I\u2019m in no rush lol). As my brain develops and I make my way toward adulthood, awareness just keeps pouring in. Grappling with everything/God/life gets exhausting sometimes and I\u2019ve struggled a lot with depression. Feeling/thinking expends a lot of energy so my brain and body turn off from time to time. Not ideal, but I assume will fade as I get older and my body gets accustomed to this large chunk of consciousness I somehow ended up with. Anyways back to my original thought. Obviously my purpose in life is to help alleviate the suffering of those who were given harder battles in life to fight. But my dilemma is I also want to enjoy all that life has to offer. I want to taste the pinnacle of worldly success. Not looking for answers, I know there are none. But alas just needed yip yap feel free to join in. Love you and thank you if you made it this far <3",

Its ordered arrangement of discs, meningeal membranes, spinal fluid, nerve roots and ganglia optimize impulse transmission.\n\nResearch on acupuncture meridians shows the spinearea contains over 50% of all EMF (electro-magnetic frequency) detection points in the body, with dense receptor distributions in the cervical and sacral plexus regions. THIS implies EM sensitivity.\n\nBiophotons transmitted by DNA have demonstrated the ability to propagate coherent light signals along the peripheral nervous system fibers using myelin sheathing as a waveguide. This demonstrates signaling capacity beyond standard action potentials.\n\nPiezoelectric effects in collagen and microtubule cytoskeletal arrangements can transduce mechanical pressures into electromagnetic oscillations and vice versa. This supports bioelectric activation.\n\nMeditation alters ion flows, neurotransmitter levels, blood distribution and biophoton emissions - possibly tuning the spine's sensitive nervous infrastructure toward non-local communication turns.\n\nThe spine anatomy provides a uniquely suited axis for consciousness expansion states to activate broader, little-studied neural sensory capacities, to receive and transmit densified psycho-sensory signals between planes, once nominal function is stilled. \n\nThe antenna awaits stillness to function.\u201d\n\nwhen I attempt to inform you of the immense powers your little human form truly possesses .. and those very powers are the key to your shift to sheen when acknowledged and utilized to their fullest extent daily .. please know I am accurate in my assertions \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\n\n\nmay the peace and love of christ, buddha and all the star gods be with you always \ud83d\udc8b",

Catherine was suffering from recurring nightmares and chronic anxiety attacks. When his traditional methods of therapy failed, Dr Weiss turned to hypnosis and was astonished and sceptical when Catherine began recalling past-life traumas which seemed to hold the key to her problems.\n\nDr Weiss\u2019s scepticism was eroded when Catherine began to channel messages from \u2018the space between lives\u2019, which contained remarkable revelations about his own life. Acting as a channel for information from highly evolved spirit entities called the Masters, Catherine revealed many secrets of life and death.\n\nThis fascinating case dramatically altered the lives of Catherine and Dr Weiss, and provides important information on the mysteries of the mind, the continuation of life after death and the influence of our past-life experiences on our present behaviour.\n\nAt the time in New Zealand I was looking for to have a past life regression but never took into serious consideration till I moved to live in London and due certain exceptionally experiences I decided it was time, a guy among others I felt drawn and few weeks later I was on my way to New Malden the London Korean community, it was a surreal foggy evening I could barely seeing where I was walking, despite that I reached the house of Nicolas Aujula a famous character in the psychic world, he was nothing of what I could expect, slim, elegant, friendly, a normal guy that would easily pass unnoticed, we introduced ourselves and he took me in the living room where I sat in a really comfortable sofa, he explained me what he was going to do and told me to relax, we started, I\u2019m honest I don\u2019t believe he hypnotised me but I can\u2019t deny that weird things happened, images popped up in my mind in unchecked way where I realised to be a man living in the middle ages abusing of a girl I felt instinctively was Julie, a Korean girl I met in New Zealand and played a massive role in my spiritual growing. \n\nThis girl still playing an important part in my life and as much I\u2019m trying to forget seems impossible, is like she is part of me and anytime she feel I\u2019m trying to cut the cords of attachment she is coming back in my mind and soul shaking me within, I can\u2019t cut the cords or maybe subconsciously I don\u2019t want. \u2026.. \n\nhttps://anextraordinaryandordinarylifeblog.wordpress.com/2023/06/05/enso/",

And he only just started introducing me to his theories about how the government has been conditioning us etc. Like I\u2019ve always known the government is bad and brainwashes us but he actually explained everything and I would just sit there high out my mind, it was so interesting to listen to. Like he would go on about giants or flat earth and everything else they lied to us \n\nAnyway it\u2019s all my fault we stopped talking, we  had a big age gap (I\u2019m 16 he\u2019s a looot older) and I got mad at him once and snitched and now we have no contact. Idk man he said all the time he feels like we\u2019re soulmates and we connected so fast and I feel like I\u2019ll never have that close romantic connection with anyone else\n\nI kept all his pictures and I genuinely just daydream about him while looking at them. I\u2019m even trying to manifest him back or at least trying to talk to him telepathically. Lol",

It freaked me out so bad I drove to my brother\u2019s house to sleepover. I felt a weird eerie feeling like I wasn\u2019t alone when it happened.",

I just graduated and am dealing with the change so I know thats a part of it. But the things I have had anxiety about and have feared and thought about so much are so bizzare that I cant tell if its just my anxiety or if im experiencing some sort of spiritual awakening. I havent done too much research on spiritual awakenings, so I cant tell. Im also a little bit of a skeptic, despite being a spiritual person. I believe that there is a connection between science and spirit, but also a balance between the two. Can someone please tell me that they've also gone through this? I feel like a child being born again. Gaining conciousness again. Like, I am realizing that I am a soul having a human experience. Whaaat?! I would and kiiinda still do have thoughts about death, whats after death, the purpose of human life, of life ifself, how time works, the universe and so on and so forth. I have thoughts about but also HEAVILY feared these things. Recently though my fear has gone down a little. Im starting to grow more interested in it and wanting to do more research. I was telling my sister about it and she just said \"let it happen\". Which yes, I dont believe the universe would work against me. But then again the universe wouldnt work against me as my soul. But what about me as a human being? Am I meant to die as a human being soon, like the horrible voice in my head says(theres so much more to this)? Idk. I know it may seem ridiculous. I want to be open and explore my spirituality even more. I know that it can be scary, but is it really THIS scary for others? I feel like Im the only one who goes through things like this. Everyone else whose shared on media their experiences has not said anything about this part. I hear about shadow people and going through rough patches in mental health. But not things like this. I feel very different then those around me. Most times its scary, but sometimes its comforting and interesting and I want to learn more. I want to lean into it. The fear is there holding me back tho, im told and convinced that the more I learn, the closer to (physical) death I am. I might also share, I have not been able to trust my intuition for the past almost 2 years. Im having a hard time trusting my intuition. Ive been doing yoga, I know thats helping me with my healing. Im seeing a therapist and healing my inner child. But what about everything else? I want to feel okay and live as a human being. Why is spiritual stuff so scary sometimes?",

          "content": "## It wasn't on a mountaintop, during a silent retreat, or even while meditating in a lotus pose. My spiritual awakening happened in the most mundane of places: my cluttered apartment, surrounded by the hum of the dishwasher and the glow of my laptop screen.\n\nI was working late, finishing up a deadline, when a wave of exhaustion washed over me. It wasn't just physical tiredness; it was a deep-seated weariness that seemed to seep into my very bones. In that moment, I felt utterly lost, disconnected from myself and the world around me.\n\nFrustrated and overwhelmed, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. And then, something unexpected happened. My thoughts, usually a swirling storm, began to quiet. The boundaries between myself and the room around me seemed to dissolve. It was as if I was merging with the air, the sounds, the very fabric of existence.\n\nTears streamed down my face, but they weren't tears of sadness. They were tears of profound gratitude, awe, and love. I felt a deep sense of interconnectedness, a knowing that I was part of something much larger than myself.\n\nMy perspective shifted from the individual to the universal. I saw the world through new eyes, filled with beauty, wonder, and possibility. My anxieties and fears, which had once loomed so large, now seemed insignificant in the face of this vast, interconnected reality.\n\nThat night, I didn't just go to sleep; I awoke to something new. It wasn't a destination, but a journey. A journey of self-discovery, of connection, and of living life with a newfound purpose.\n\nWhile my experience may not be typical, it's a testament to the fact that spiritual awakening can happen anywhere, anytime. It's not reserved for the yogis on mountaintops or the monks in monasteries. It's available to anyone who is open to it, willing to look within, and ready to surrender to the transformative power of the universe.\n\nAnd I stumbled upon [this article](https://medium.com/@Nsha_67/answering-the-call-a-beginners-guide-to-awakening-your-spiritual-potential-5d1f3188cc69) on [Medium.com](https://Medium.com).

I cant understand if i should find something to \"love\" or enjoy, or what am i missing in my life. All of this keeps me always in chronic stress. And also why i said that im dealing with identity crisis, i feel like even if i resolve all the trauma i feel like i dont know myself anymore, what i want to do, what should i do, am i doing something right...\nAny advice?",

For most of my life, I\u2019ve been able to \u201cmask\u201d this feeling of emptiness. Especially in social situations where I feel fragmented. It\u2019s like there\u2019s no solid self and I grasp until fragments to just get by in social situations. I always feel disconnected even around people I trust or like. \n\nThe only time I don\u2019t is when I\u2019m alone or in nature. During the pandemic, I moved back home, quit my corporate job, and basically hit the restart button on my life. A lot of shadow work too. Not that I had much of a choice I guess lol \n\nToday, I met with old friends for the first time since 2019. I felt really disconnected and empty once again. That sense of no autonomy came back and the loneliness hit. \n\nI also suspect I might be neurodivergent which contributes to some challenges socially. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t relax or be comfortable in my own skin. \n\nMy safe place is my inner world at home. But at the same time, I feel disconnected from the outer world and being bogged down in your subconscious isn\u2019t necessarily conducive. \n\nBut since the awakening, I\u2019ve felt more alone than ever. Or maybe just more aware? Is awakening suppose to be this painful? Anyone else have gone through this?",

          "content": "I just finished reading this book by Deepak Chopra that outlines seven principles that can lead to a fulfilling and successful life. These laws are based on natural laws and spiritual principles. Here they are:\n\n1. **The Law of Pure Potentiality**: This law is about understanding the essence of our being, which is pure consciousness. It suggests that recognizing and tapping into this source can lead to a life of true success.\n2. **The Law of Giving**: This law emphasizes that the universe operates through dynamic exchange. Giving and receiving are different aspects of the flow of energy in the universe, and a willingness to give what you seek can keep abundance circulating in your life.\n3. **The Law of Karma (or Cause and Effect)**: This law states that every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in kind. Choosing actions that bring happiness and success to others ensures the flow of happiness and success to you.\n4. **The Law of Least Effort**: This principle is about practicing acceptance and non-resistance. When your actions are motivated by love, and you expend the least effort, you tap into the infinite organizing power of the universe.\n5. **The Law of Intention and Desire**: This law is based on the fact that energy and information exist everywhere in nature. Human intention and desire, when grounded in this field of energy and information, have the power to orchestrate their own fulfillment.\n6. **The Law of Detachment**: This law suggests that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquish your attachment to it. This doesn't mean you give up the intention to create your desire, but you give up your attachment to the outcome.\n7. **The Law of Dharma (or Purpose in Life)**: According to this law, everyone has a purpose in life, a unique gift or special talent to give to others. When we blend this unique talent with service to others, we experience the ecstasy and exultation of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of all goals.\n\nThese principles aim to provide a spiritual foundation for material and personal success, emphasizing harmony with the universe and the importance of understanding and aligning with natural and spiritual laws.",

A little back story is I believe I started my awakening about a year ago after a very intense and depressing period of time loosing a job and some people I cared about.\n I started being aware of more things, mainly the feelings of energy and the shifting and movement. I started mindful meditation. I don\u2019t really like definitions but I spoz in the situation I\u2019d describe myself as an empath.  I\u2019m adding that because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related to my story here.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing- recently I started feeling at random times, deep down , I needed to listen or something or someone was trying to tell me something. Along with the feeling comes this pressure for lack of better word , sensation in my forehead. \n This may be completely the wrong place to post this. If so , I guess maybe a suggestion as to the right place would be great. My big question is though, anyone know what\u2019s going on here with this?",

I felt the universe and my soul intertwining, and all my worries were gone. I felt deep gratitude for everything in my life and I never needed even to remind myself to say to myself what I was greatful for. All my friends there were the same. Everything was amazing. \n\nWhen the semester at uni started in the beginning of september I went back to Sweden. I was nervous, due to the fact that I had no one to talk about this with and that everyone here is the same. They're not rude or anything, it's just that they never have ideas or thoughts that are about anything else than their house, their studies and what they'll to the coming weekend. In the beginning I didn't mind, I did my own thing. But now, in the beginning of december, I caught myself in the same tracks as them. I can't remember the last time I felt gratitude without anyone asking me what I'm grateful for or when I lost my connection to the universe. \n\nSince I live in southern Sweden one reason could be that I haven't seen the sun in a couple of weeks (I felt a deep connection to the sun during the summer). However there is nothing I can do about this, it will take two more months at least before the sun starts peeking out. \n\nHas anyone of you experienced this? How did you move on? I don't like feeling like I'm in the hamster wheel again: just running around chasing nothing of matter. Do you have any tips?",

          "content": "How should i act when i clearly called out a young pimp for trying to be romeo pimp (lover boy) on me to make money out of me while he was pretending to like me and was using a lot of tactics to make me wants him. I NEVER NEVER gave anyone there any right to do that. I am super low profile with good education and a really serious girl. I have never slept around in my whole life and i only care for meaninfull deep relationships/friendships.\n\nI was super calm when i called him out at first without swearing or being mad or anything i just let him know i know what he does so he would stop! But he DIDN'T he kept doing the same tactics again ana again, like i am an idiot ! So after that i literally slightly bullied him, i was talking to another women and telling stuff that he knew it was about him so he literally dissappeared and never saw him for 2 months. Then he came again and i pretend to talk to phone about him and swear EXTREMELY bad i literally belittle him as much as i could and then he disappeared for 4-5 months! And now he appeared again I KNEW that if i would not bully him he would annoy me and come around every day. And this exactly what he does. He literally changed the days he come to come when i go ! And i am started to get annoyed. Its like someone is clearly coming in front of my face and telling me that he wants to steal from me and like i do nothing! I don't agree with doing nothing cause it does not work! Plus even if i am not so mad now i know i will be cause they repeat (he and others but he is the worse) the same cycle again and again and again even if they see it does not work.\n\nI know it might not be the right sub for this (i don't think there is any sub actually for pimps) but i would like to read some replies that might help me.\n\nOne thing is sure if you leave them they will annoy you! Cause you give them space. And i cannot just tell him to not talk to me cause he does not talk. He just comes around or look at me from distance. If they were talking and just ask my phone it would be easy cause i would just tell them to not annoy. But even this would not work. Cause when i was mad cause one of them was staring at me he said he didn't and he keeps coming around like nothing happened! Nothing works with them. ",

          "content": "Hello I had a question about my visualization skills. When I meditate, I see black and purple/violet smoke, when I meditate long enough, the purple/violet smoke gets darker in color and is more prominent. At one point I saw eyes in the smoke and the heard a voice that called herself hekate and we talked.  I also now see shapes and very trippy designs but it\u2019s hidden behind the smoke so I\u2019ll see it only faintly, what does that mean? Also Last time I cried a lot, the smoke went away and I saw my body but it didn\u2019t have the face but had the head, I was more built and had dreads it seemed like and they were outlined blue. Now that before I could experience and experiment with it, I went through some trauma and the smoke came back, what is the meaning of crying to get the smoke to go away and the person staring back at me when I close my eyes? Idk what seeing the body is and if that controls the minds eye. I plan on taking edibles and thinking to myself \u201ccry\u201d over and over again bc last time I did, I tried bc I put myself into a sense of hypnosis very quickly and I cry like crazy when I never cry tbh. It works but I took time away from drugs but I plan on doing it after I take this drug test. Any help would help on what that body is and why crying gets rid of the smoke covering my visuals",

I have always been a little than more connected to my spiritual side no matter how realistic I force myself to be. My dreams have been on the extremes the last few months as well as almost daily very strong Deja vu. My intuition seems to be screaming at me more than usual as well. \n\nThis dream has been bothering me all day:\n\nFor backstory My little sister passed away at 5/o 10 years ago when I was 15. Allot has changed and my family adopted two other children. Last night I had a dream she came back, and it was wonderful but after a while I realized I couldn't find my adopted siblings. Turns out we could only have her or them. My mom decided to go with my little sister, and they walked away into a tunnel, and I was left behind with my two adopted siblings. It's been a while since I've had a dream this strong, and it's been affecting me all day. What does this mean?\n\nAlso, before my sister passed, I had reoccurring dreams of her passing away a certain way and she ended up passing away the same as my dreams very suddenly. Right before she got sick, she kept talking about a new imaginary friend and had a panic attack about what was going to happen to her toys when she passed (again not sick yet). During the short time she was in the hospital I had experience sleep paralysis of a figure in my room and after that she passed.\n\nI have had a lot more experiences of when my dreams become reality as well as my intuition proving to be correct, but these are the most significant.",

          "content": "I have been dealing with at least three evil spirits for several years now. I know I am schizophrenic, but I didn't simply label everything as an illusion. For in the universe, all thought it creation. I developed a way to guide myself through psychosis and other states. I would like to say that psychosis is a great opportunity to do deep work.\n\nI call my philosophy The Framework of Thought. A Frame is where our current attention is - it is the now. (Moving faster than 60 frames per second.) For every frame there is the subject, and then there is the context. It is in understanding the context of frame that we begin to peer into the depths of our subconscious mind. \n\nAnother key factor is looking into the metaphysics of determining what creates good and bad energy. For this, we must examine the hearts response to frame. I have this down to three questions. The hearts response is determined by 1. Whether is it true or not. 2. Whether it is good or bad. 3. Whether it relates to you. For each of these three there is an emotional reaction based on the response.\n\nSo in psychosis, if it is not true it can be dismissed. Whether it is good or bad ultimately determines the difference between dopamine or cortisol. Whether it relates to you or not is also used by the ego to decide if it can dismiss what is happening. It is important to recognize that good or bad energy is literally our hearts response to the determination of if something is good or bad. It's that simple.\n\nIt is in changing the context that evil entities are able to condition us without us knowing. We are only looking at the subject unaware of the context, and thus they change the context (in ways that are not true) so that they can condition us with negative associations in an attempt to control our thinking. There is a simple solution to this. Examine the context. \n\nWhenever a negative association or trigger arises, instead of being conditioned to react negatively and run away from the idea all together, it is better to examine the context to then make the idea produce positive emotion. This can be done by addressing assumptions, developing deeper insight, looking at the idea from different angels, understanding other shoes better, or even alternative story telling based on positive assumptions that changes the way you feel about the subject. \n\nIf you understand this you understand the difference between your own personal heaven or hell. By auditing yourself according to the above, you can reprogram your subconscious to produce positive energy. Every single thought and emotion is stored in the subconscious, so it's important to really know that everything you are exposed to will end up as programming in the subconscious. Create positive associations with as many ideas as possible in the \"now\" before you let them go.\n\nI have a lot of details involved and notes for my actual philosophy. However, I believe the above is the most important parts that piece it together roughly in order to make the philosophy (understanding) as actionable as possible. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions!  \n",

          "content": "So I got a sound bowl two years ago for my 18th birthday but I never found the time to use it. Then a few months ago I was looking into sound therapy to reduce the programming of music on my brain (In my religion music is banned) and so i realized the sound bowl can produce binaural beats naturally in contrast to the computer generated binaural beats.\n\nI was using the sound bowl simply for experimenting with potent frequencies on my brain, but what I found next was nothing short of a miracle in my eyes.\n\nYou see I\u2019ve been suffering from auditory and visual hallucinations for a hot minute now, and soon the more I started striking the sound bowl, the more it began to neutralize the hallucinations as it overpowered the noise in my brain. It\u2019s weird, it\u2019s like the binaural beats are digging deep within my mind and cancelling out all the noise it produces.\n\nThere is something psychological about sound therapy that taps into the unseen parts of the mind in where hallucinations are produced. My conspiracy theory behind it is that my brain produces low frequencies that I cannot hear that spawns the hallucinations. And so when I play potent healthy frequencies it taps into the root cause of the hallucinations, essentially nipping it in the bud.\n\nThis has been an amazing coping mechanism for my schizophrenia and I\u2019ve likened it to a fidget toy for people with adhd. This is like a spiritual fidget toy for people with schizophrenia.\n\nI hope this knowledge benefits you in some way. I am currently writing a 40 day journal on the sound therapy and it\u2019s going by really well.\n\nThanks for reading! Have a wonderful day.",

But then another thing that also helped is that it can't be ruled out that there is not an intelligence that is the universe or all energy and therefore includes 'us' so we are that intelligence and that is who we really are, again we were never an individual and we were always the oneness and are just as much everyone and everything else as much as the body we are looking from.

I need a spiritual cleanse for real.\n\nAny advice on what to do here?",

          "content": "I have almost always been a deeply analytical man, especially after my days of lsd and mushroom use in my late teenage/early adult years. Consequently, the rest of my life is not as well. I am 28 currently. My body is in poor shape and seems to be decaying. It has become unsightly. I have little ambition in the material world and most of my days are spent doing nothing but thinking while at home and so I still work minimum wage. And I am deeply troubled by experiences I have had in the past week, roughly.\n\nI had an experience the other day that was so intense it brought me to tears and each day past this I have been deep in thought contemplating the things I have come upon, which troubled me so much in the awe i had at them that i wouldnt dare even speak them, and feel paranoid even thinking them now. The fear that I have is this. The material world I am living in, I am becoming increasingly aware, is reflecting the spiritual struggles I am having. And it almost feels like the people around me can see them. It stresses me out at work to the point that I nearly have to stop altogether.\n\nOn the one hand, I am awed at the newfound feelings that are developing in me. On the other, I am deeply troubled by the sense that I am being courted by different forces, spiritually, but am unable to discern what is what, but there is a call that I should wake up and start acting out in the flesh and this makes me afraid. I feel as if, if I choose wrong, I will be destroyed. I feel like despite the people around me giving me constant affirmations, I am secretly despised. I feel like I can smell myself intensely and it as an unpleasant scent but am assured by others that they can not smell a thing. I had a disturbing experience today. I had an intense moment of spiritual trouble at work, and then things around me started getting weird. My coworker became almost dazed and wouldn't speak when I responded to her and looked at me in some sort of odd 'knowing' way, referring to the things happening in my mind. At the store tonight, a woman stopped in the aisle in front of me and stood with her mouth gaping, staring at me, even after I said hello. She was just stunned. \n\nI live in Los Angeles and part of me feels like I just want to run away as fast as I can, but part of me feels like I am a prisoner in the flesh here. I feel like I am having some kind of psychotic episode and yet I am totally lucid. Not sure what else to say or what I am looking for in response. Thanks.",

          "content": "Hello all, peace and blessings. Over the last couple years, I\u2019ve gotten deeper into my meditation and spiritual practices. For roughly a month or two now, I\u2019ve been seeing angel numbers EVERYWHERE. There have been days where I\u2019ve seen almost every single repeating number\u2014via the clock, license plates, street addresses and even on someone else\u2019s phone when I happened to look down at an outing. \n\nWhile out at the bar or social events-I\u2019ve seen angel numbers tattooed on people that walk right by me. If I recall, one night I saw 1111 222 555 444 888 all via tattoos on different people. \n\nThese occurrences were strange at first but I\u2019ve seen it so often that it\u2019s become a new norm. However, recently I\u2019ve started to hear angel numbers. Literal synchronicities in normal everyday conversations. A couple of the major real life examples I\u2019ve experienced are:\n\n 1. Walking into a restaurant to pick up some carry out and at that moment hearing the waitress call out a ticket number to the back she says \u201cThe next ticket roundup is set for the kitchen, start with ticket \u2018333\u2019.. oh sorry I meant \u2018222\u2019\u201d.  My thoughts: out of all the possible number combinations what are the chances those two ticket #s are called. At that exact moment.\n\n2. This occurred a half hour ago and was the inspiration for this question/post. \nI\u2019m taking an Uber back and the driver is telling me about her day and how she didn\u2019t sleep at all. She said \u201cMy husband had me up binge watching this show. It was like 15 episodes and it finally ended at 2:22\u201d\nMy thoughts: she could\u2019ve said any time any variation of times. Also how did she remember such a specific time, instead of saying \u201clike or around 2\u201d\n\nThese instances were so attention grabbing that it literally froze me in place. I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s no such thing as coincidences or happenstance. Especially within the understandings of spirituality. These signs are so profound and constant. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t been able find one question on hearing angel numbers in this manner. It\u2019s just the usual inquiries on seeing them and their meanings.\n\nDoes anyone else have experience in receiving spiritual messages in this manner?",

That purpose is to raise our consciousness, raise our vibrations, and in turn raise the vibration of all of humanity  to usher in a new, golden age on earth.

By raising our vibrations, we can make sure that the old is replaced by a new that works for all of us. \nWe are all connected; not just people but all of nature, and by always choosing Love and light over fear and darkness, by listening to the True self over the small self, we can save this world.

Compared to just being, and being with the flesh I instead will feel like a part of my being without the body, and feel as if I'm kind of just in a pretend body suit. When I feel this way I'll try and find the closest mirror and feel shocked at what I see. As if I had to remind myself who I am in the physical world. And I'll challenge this by looking deeply into my eyes. Into the iris, and then into the pupil and it never lasts too long because I'll get this unsettling feeling of what I'm witnessing deep into my core.\n Not that I'm scared, I don't believe there's anything to be afraid of there but it's like a part of my subconscious is trying to hold me back from realizing or feeling anything further. Compare this to a time of feeling \"normal\" which is majority of the time outside of these \"moments\", I can look myself in the mirror no problem and understand what I'm seeing is what I've always known to be and have become familiar with since gaining consciousness as a human. Nothing deeper than the flesh. No deeper thought about it, just more-so artificial and superficial thoughts that we're programmed to think when we see ourselves. But other times it feels like I'm seeing something that doesn't make sense in the physical world. I'm seeing something my eyes aren't supposed to see.\n\nYes I'm sober. I don't drink. Most I do is micro dose with mushrooms here and there. I'm not on medication or diagnosed with anything. I don't feel it's a mental issue because even with these feelings sometimes occurring, I'm genuinely a happy person naturally.

Nothing matters, and yet, we continue to exist. \n\nRecently I've realized that nothingness and somethingness are indistinct; all matter is made of empty space and energy, which too, when frozen in time, is void. Physicality is an illusion. \"Nothing\" literally \"matters.\" \n\nBut what purpose does this serve if nothing matters, if everything is meaningless? Well, if nothing and everything are indistinct, and nothing matters, then everything simultaneously does and doesn't matter. I suppose it is a matter of perspective; which is why consciousness is divided, such that it may perceive a perspective (ego) that is capable of abstraction, deriving meaning. Death leads to rebirth, and the ego is no exception, for it is the will of the universe to perceive. \n\nAny other insights?",

          "score": 7,
          "author": "daniel_shkolnik",
          "content": "Over a year ago, I went through what I can only describe as an awakening experience, non-dual state, or \"spiritual emergence.\"\n\nPopular spiritual notions of \"awakening\" make it seem like it's the best thing that could possibly happen to you. What they don't mention is the psychological turbulence of premature awakening.\n\nAwakening is not about becoming morally perfect, healing the sick, or becoming all-knowing. Awakening is simply realizing our true nature: the felt sense that we are the cosmos, and the cosmos is us. This truth opens our heart to flowing love. It liberates us from our cramped personal identities. We become capable of immense compassion, free from attachment, and directly connected to the sacred nature of the universe. It is the central teaching of all mystical traditions.\n\nBut truly believing\u2014and living\u2014this truth can be frightening and destabilizing.\n\nA spiritual emergence can lead to what Stan Groff called a \"spiritual emergency.\"In an attempt to make sense of my own experience, I began seeking out and speaking to people who have had awakening experiences.They are far more common than I previously thought, and they can be far more challenging and destabilizing than I imagined.\n\nThree people I spoke with entered into psyche wards as a result of their awakening. One person experienced weeks to months of debilitating, nightmarish disillusionment. Saeed Khan, a consciousness teacher I spoke with, described how his awakening led to a prolonged state of clarity, after which he fell into intense depression before stabilizing himself. (I've had my own struggles integrating my experience, and I am grateful to Saeed and a few close friends for supporting me in challenging moments.)\n\nSaeed introduced me to the term \"stable awakening,\" and I feel like that hits the nail on the head. Stability is what's missing in discussions of awakening, and in the global spiritual culture more broadly.Moving forward, I am committing to speak openly and clearly about my experience of awakening. This is for two reasons:\n\n1. Living from a place of awakened consciousness may be the single most important shift we can make in our lives and for our world.\n2. This shift can be immensely confusing and difficult without support.\n\nThe mental health system (and psychology in general) aims to create ego-stability. It has virtually no frameworks for ego-transcendence, and as a result pathologizes awakening / emergence. According to Christina and Stanislav Grof:... many of the conditions, which are currently diagnosed as psychotic and indiscriminately treated by suppressive medication, are actually difficult stages of a radical personality transformation and of spiritual opening. If they are correctly understood and supported, these psychospiritual crises can result in emotional and psychosomatic healing, \\[and\\] remarkable psychological transformation.\n\nPsychology tries to strengthen and secure the ego. And while strengthening the ego is a valuable first step to transcending the ego, it only gets us so far.\n\nAs a result of my experience, a focus of my work has become studying and helping others achieve stable awakening or stabilize an awakening they're already going through.I've helped several people navigate difficult awakening experiences. In particular, those who come from non-religious backgrounds or who may not seek out traditional Buddhist, Hindu, or non-dual religious teachers. I am not a spiritual master, but I can offer psychological and spiritual tools that will better prepare people for and stabilize an awakening.\n\nIf you or someone you know is going through a difficult awakening experience and are looking for some help, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to be a resource for those who need it. I can also connect you with other enlightenment teachers, like Saeed and others, whom I've worked with and trust.\n\nAs Ram Dass said, 'we are all just walking each other home.'",

Now I have tried to accept these thoughts as just thoughts, but one thought keeps coming up. If the Bible is the word of god, then the thoughts are real.  It was written by god, they are not just thoughts they are god\u2019s word, right? Idk, does anybody have any thoughts on this?",

Prayer Mudra. The Buddha in Me recognizes the Buddha in You. The One and The Many.  How Unity arrives.\u201d\n\n\nI found this to be an eloquent and interesting explanation of the most common human position in yoga and meditation \ud83d\ude4f \n               the namaskara \n\nand I wish that you contemplate this as you meditate .. daily, making the time to ask the universe for your guides to come and speak with you .. for the world, as one collective community, to finally seek, and find, peace .. and the Light guide YOU on your path to the sheen \ud83d\udc9c\n\n               \ud83e\udeb7 namaste \ud83e\udeb7",

I have a tendency of down spiraling in my head, overthinking and a lot of negative self talk, so I have been trying positive affirmations in the morning and before I go to sleep. It felt silly honestly, and I haven\u2019t been consistent with it as well, but today felt different. I took the time to sit and just breathe. I acknowledged my body and everything I was feeling, my heartbeat and how I was breathing. I acknowledged my emotions, and the pain and hurt I have been feeling, the anger and frustration. And I just started praying and talking to God about how lost and confused I feel. Then I started reciting positive affirmations of the things I want to feel, and I just felt this release. It started in my chest, like a knot that was growing in my chest, and I just kept reciting the positive affirmations. The knot in my chest got tighter, and I started crying, but I didn\u2019t stop and I just allowed myself to feel what I was feeling in that moment. I\u2019m new to all this spirituality stuff, I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but whatever it is that just happened to me felt really good.",

I will bathe you with herbs, I will purge you, and you will vomit the rage and the darkness inside you. I'll press your body with good herbs, and I'll put you to lay in the grass, face up to the sky. Then I will breathe into your crown to clean the old memories that make you repeat the same behavior.*\n\n*I will breathe into your forehead to scare away the thoughts that cloud your vision. I will breathe into your throat to release the knot that won't let you talk. I will breathe into your heart to scare fear, so that it goes far away where it cannot find you. I will breathe into your solar plexus to extinguish the fire of the hell you carry inside, and you will know peace.*\n\n*I will breathe with fire into your belly to burn the attachments, and the love that was not. I will breathe away the lovers that left you, the children that never came. I will breathe into your heart to make you warm, to rekindle your desire to feel, create and start again. I will breathe with force into your loins, to clean the sexual door to your soul.*\n\n*I will breathe away the garbage that you collected trying to love what did not want to be loved. I will use the broom, and the sponge, and the rag, and safely clean all the bitterness inside you. I will breathe into your hands to destroy the ties that prevent you from creating. I will breathe into your feet to dust and erase the footprints memories, so you can never return to that bad place.*\n\n\n*I will turn your body, so your face will kiss the earth. I'll breathe into your spine from the root to the neck to increase your strength and help you walk upright. And I will let you rest.*\n\n\n*After this you will cry, and after crying you will sleep, And you will dream beautiful and meaningful dreams, and when you wake up I'll be waiting for you. I will smile at you, and you will smile back. I will offer you food that you will eat with pleasure, tasting life, and I will thank you. Because what I\u2019m offering today, was offered to me before when darkness lived within me. And after I was healed, I felt the darkness leaving, and I cried.*\n\n\n*Then we will walk together, and I will show you my garden, and my plants, and I will take you to the fire again. And will talk together in a single voice with the blessing of the earth. And we will shout to the forest the desires of your heart. And the fire will listen and whisper the echo, and we will create hope together. And the mountains will listen and whisper the echo, and we will create hope together. And the rivers will listen and whisper the echo, and we will create hope together. And the wind will listen and whisper the echo, and we will create hope together.*\n\n\n*And then we will bow before the fire, and we will call upon all the visible and invisible guardians.*\n\n\n*And you will say thank you to all of them.*\n\n*And you will say thank you to yourself.*\n\n*And you will say thank you to yourself.*\n\n*And you will say thank you to yourself.\"*\n\nAlexander Khimushin: Udege grandma.

This has been going on a few weeks now with no other symptoms or feeling sick in any other way. I recently went to the Dr. to make sure I had no health issues and I do not. I never get hot like this durning the day. The only thing I can think of is some kind of ascension symptoms. I\u2019ve had some major breakthroughs lately in some traumas and limiting beliefs work so maybe it\u2019s that? This has happened to me in the past before and lasted a short time since my journey started but never this severe or for this long. I can\u2019t find anything about this problem online. Most articles will bring up hormonal hot flashes but looking in to typical hot flashes symptoms, this is not what I feel like is going on. Has anyone else had this issue on their journey?

I felt an overflow of emotion when she removed her hand and then 5 minutes later she announced to me she is pregnant?!!!!!\n\n-me and gf were driving through an affluent neighborhood and I was looking at the houses and manifesting a life that looked like the one I was seeing; we passed house number 1818 and I googled the angel number to find out that it means \u201cyour angels want you to move in the direction of prosperity and abundance\u201d. \n\nAll of this being said, I have been feeling strange. I have this heavy feeling of angst that will not go away- like I am meant to be pursuing something that I am not aware of yet or like I need to travel somewhere for something? It\u2019s like the universe is trying to lead me somewhere but I wasn\u2019t given a map or instructions. \n\nYesterday my girlfriend and I were out and about and she randomly suggested we visit a crystal shop. We wandered into a nearby joint and the woman who owned the shop felt like someone I needed to connect with. Prior to entering the shop, my gf and I sat in the car talking and I mentioned that the neighborhood we were in had very high vibrational energy. \n\nWhen we entered the shop, The older English woman was speaking with us and she basically said verbatim that \u201cshe loves this area because it\u2019s very high vibration\u201d. My jaw dropped. \n\nThis woman had the most peaceful, calming energy I had ever encountered. We spoke very briefly, but in the time that we spent talking she shared things with me that impacted me heavily. I wanted to listen to her talk forever. She also made VERY random comments about past trauma and how these are things we have to accept and let go of, but it felt like she was reading me and providing intuition hand tailored for me somehow.\n\nI think the reason that this interaction was significant to me is because I have met many people who claim to be spiritual or enlightened in some way, but I find it\u2019s often very superficial \u201cspirituality\u201d which is not honed yet. I remember speaking with a priest about spiritual experiences that I was having and he basically told me that I\u2019m looking for things that aren\u2019t there.\n\nAnyway, this whole interaction felt magical. Now I\u2019m just here evaluating my whole life trying to figure out why I think this woman from the shop is meant to be my spiritual guide or something.i have not been able to stop thinking about the crystal shop or the woman since yesterday. I hardly know her. Do I sound crazy? Someone help me out here because I\u2019m not too sure how to proceed. How can I figure out what I am meant to be doing ?",

Who thought of these laws? They seem to just be a mashup of different philosophies and belief systems that are widely recognized as truth.\n\nLike the law of nonresistance is something that has been a major crutch in my life (and is the base of Taoism), and something that has brought me peace in life, but no resource acknowledges it. Nor the law of impermanence? All articles just regurgitate the same interpretations?\n\nSo I decided to write about my interpretation of these laws, and my understanding of how the universe works from a spiritual perspective.\n\nHope this makes sense and feels intuitive, cause it did for me.

          "content": "I began my spiritual journey earlier this year and ever since, I've been taking my time with savoring each season as they come, making myself cozy and comfortable in each one. However, now that we're past Thanksgiving, I'm feeling reluctant to embrace the winter season as the \"Christmas/holiday\" season because of all the stress that comes with it. I'm absolutely not ready to force myself to be jolly and giving when I'm not feeling that way. I think a lot of society's problems have stressed me enough to not have the energy to. \n\nWith where our society is today, I feel a split between consumerism vs spiritualism and the shift of people realizing how material \"bargains\" are just scams at this point. I'm also finding it stressful that the people around me are more prone to materialism than I am but I think what's stressing me more is that they want things to continue as they did in the past as if nothing is different and that nothing is changing. I know that not everyone is gonna be where I'm at with this but I wish I had the energy to try to help them understand. \n\nWith all that said, I'm having a rough time deciding my place with my efforts of gifting things this year whether it be store-bought or handmade, overthinking about who deserves what from me and if it's even worth the effort and if they would even appreciate or make use of the gift. Money is definitely a factor in the stress and I'm hesitating at making any consumerist move at all. I feel like pinching pennies is more important or worthwhile than spending on loved ones who will have expected more from me. \n\nI guess I'm seeking validation in the sense that I may not be alone with how I'm feeling. Being on this journey on my own makes me feel lonely from time to time which I think lowers my vibration and makes life feel harder than it should. I know we're here to learn and to make the most out of our existence but I'm feeling stuck where I am at with my life and that nothing is really moving forward. Any advice or words of encouragement are deeply appreciated. \n\nThank you if you've read this whole thing, I appreciate you. \n\nTldr: Society's consumerism mentality sucks. Gift giving is mentally, emotionally, financially taxing now. What even is life anymore?",

          "content": "*this post contains an experience of a Native American menstruation ritual I tried years ago and am curious if anyone can relate or provide more insight*\n\nHello everyone. After at least a decade of deprioritizing anything having to do with spirituality, I feel my spirit stirring again. It feels good to acknowledge that while also holding space for some fear and anxiety. I really struggled with my initial spiritual awakening as I felt like I teetered on the line of psychosis at times. After two years (19-21 yrs old) of what felt like an internal spiritual all out war and insanity, I managed to put down the fight and do my best to live a normal grounded life, which I have until recently (33). After a few recent lucid dreams, I am once again preoccupied mainly by one profound experience I had when I was about 20. And it occurred while committing to a Native American menstrual ritual during the first day of one cycle. \n\nIt may or may not be relevant to some that I point out that I have Apache ancestry about 15% from my dads side. But I wasn\u2019t raised with this tradition. I once took a class on Native American history while in college and was learning about different rituals/traditions. I learned about \u201cMoon Time Lodge\u201d which is a time for women to retreat, relax, meditate, and perhaps go on a vision quest during menstruation. Forgive me for forgetting the specifics of variations amongst tribes, but some were communal rituals and others were solitary rituals. Either way, this time was treated as very spiritually powerful and even ripe for visionary experiences. I was extra fascinated by this tradition because since I was 13 I\u2019ve had excruciating periods (endometriosis being common among women on my dads side) where I\u2019m truly incapacitated even from speaking/walking. I\u2019m able to manage it with preemptive measures, but if I miss that small window, it\u2019s rather hopeless for a day. With no expectations whatsoever of a vision quest, I thought I\u2019d try a solitary day of meditation while on my period with simple goals of healing and rest.  \n\nThe rules were: no technology, no contact with anyone whatsoever, it\u2019s best to not even have the opportunity to glance at or hear another person, and to try and do only passive activities. I took one normal dose of ib prophen to prevent a full blown episode and that\u2019s basically what I did. I was home for the summer, so my parents were home at night but I was pretty much able to achieve total isolation although I maybe heard them speak once or twice. I prepared all the food I would eat for the day so I didn\u2019t even have to leave my room (bathroom when no one was around) Anyway the day went by really fast and I was just straight chillin in peace. Minimal pain. And It\u2019s actually surprising I didn\u2019t get bored in hindsight especially with no technology. I felt like I read, laid around and it was time for bed.\n\nThis is where the experience begins though. I fall asleep and I feel like I immediately wake up INTO a lucid dream. I have no body and everything around me is completely white. It feels like pure consciousness but I\u2019m still me, just a very raw pure form of me. It was so pleasantly content I can\u2019t even put into words. There was love emanating but it wasn\u2019t overwhelming. There was a calmness to it. Then I slowly become aware of a woman\u2019s presence who is somehow to my right even though we don\u2019t have bodies. I\u2019m really happy to feel her, she seems familiar. She brings my attention to a male presence who is to my left and the energy drops. I\u2019m not so happy to feel him there. Mind you during this time I\u2019m becoming a little more like my earthly self. A little less raw and little more textured. And I kind of think to myself \u201cugh what\u2019s he doing here\u201d and he feels very sad, sorry, almost pathetic. And I do feel bad but it was also such a downer from where I was at. And the woman\u2019s presence asked me telepathically \u201cdo you forgive him\u201d and I bring my attention back to the male presence and he\u2019s telepathically asking me to punish him, to reciprocate what he did to me. But my mind couldn\u2019t even process or know or remember who he was or what he did even tho he was so unpleasantly familiar. I feel like he might be a repressed memory. In my typically avoidant fashion i \u201csaid\u201d to her \u201cyeah sure\u201d almost trying to rush him out of there without really absolving either of us of anything. The woman then emanated a slight sense of the most compassionate disappointment  and I instantly fell to earth in physical form.\n\nHer invisible presence is still with me after i plummeted to the ground almost comically. and there\u2019s a little jar of \u201cpotion\u201d and she guides me to drink it. She telepathically tells me that \u201cinternal chaos\u201d will now ensue and that I will die, and that my goal is to be \u201cat peace\u201d at the moment of death and to just go about my life and maybe to visit some people before it happens. Meanwhile, I\u2019m actually still glowing and radiating some of that light consciousness from the white space like kinda high from it. And I\u2019m just like \u201cyou bet no problem piece of cake, catch you in the white space\u201d she leaves and now I\u2019m on my way to have a day with the knowledge I\u2019m gunna die pretty soon. It then becomes a lot less lucid where I\u2019m visiting friends and stuff like that. But then at the very end my childhood best friend says to me \u201chey G, don\u2019t you have to catch a flight?\u201d And then suddenly I remembered im going to die soon and anxiety started to set in. I thought to myself I don\u2019t want to die on a plane. I want to die on the the ground. I realize I\u2019m failing the mission by not being at peace and i start to spiral. I take out a paper and pen and I write this letter verbatim \u201cto my friends and family, this all happened for a reason. Blessings and please believe\u201d except I could NOT write the word believe, I kept crossing it out, not liking the way it looked, spelling it wrong etc. then suddenly I finished the word once and for all and I woke up, cartoonishly jolted out upright, sweating, heart racing.\n\nI know I may have failed but I still feel healed in a way by this experience, but like there is so much more work to do. Im so grateful for that white space. I\u2019m revisiting this experience and I want to ask you all if you have any experience with this realm and/or tradition. Any and all insight is welcome. Thank you so much for reading my story. It feels really good to share it. I am even considering finding a way to research this this phenomena during menstruation in a real way. It feels so accessible. \n\nWith love",

          "content": "My name is Tirtha,\n\nI am a lifelong monk, and I want to share my story. Since monks don\u2019t usually do that, I thought maybe this would inspire someone or at least would be interesting.\n\nI always believed in God. Although my family wasn\u2019t very religious, I was raised as a Christian and ever since I was a little kid I always longed for a personal connection with God. I wanted Jesus to be my friend, I wanted Him to talk to me. I was praying and looking for Him, but I could not find Him. I could not find peace in my prayers.\n\nIn my early teens, I still considered myself a Christian, but doubts and questions about my faith entered my heart. I had questions that could not be answered. The more I asked the more confused I got. Instead of answers I received chastisement, \u201cHave faith in God\u201d and etc. The history of the Christian Church didn\u2019t increase my faith either. Gradually, I started looking for answers elsewhere. \n\nGrowing up I didn\u2019t have real friends; nobody could understand my heart. In school and in parties I would always put on a mask. I would pretend to be one of cool kids. I would hang out with the popular kids just because I was afraid of missing out. But very quickly I started to see how meaningless the things that \u2018cool kids\u2019 cared about were: wealth, popularity, status, external beauty, and so on\u2026 As I got older, my so-called friends started noticing that I was different. Although did really well in school I didn\u2019t want what society was pushing down my throat (9-5 job, family, kids) either. \n\nI have never had sex, drunk alcohol or smoked in my life, although I was surrounded by people who were always engaged in drinking, smoking, parties, drugs, sex, sleep, repeat. Maybe I was a drunkard in my past life, because I never judged others. But in my heart, I had a conviction that I would never try any of those things. Eventually, my so-called friends got tired of me. I became like a thorn to them\u00ad\u2013 me not smoking or drinking made them feel guilty. I stopped going to parties and they stopped inviting me. Now I was alone, but I didn\u2019t have to pretend anymore, I felt liberated. It felt like a wake-up call from God, as if He wanted me to follow find my true self. \n\nI felt a calling inside my heart. God was calling me. He was waiting for His lost child. But I couldn\u2019t find him. I needed a way to communicate with him, but I couldn\u2019t speak His language. I always had great respect for anyone trying to advance on their spiritual path, but I couldn\u2019t find my own path. So far, the languages I knew felt incomplete. I couldn\u2019t fully express myself.\n\nIn my late teens I started exploring Eastern religions. Buddhism helped me a lot, yet still, after hours of meditation, I would ask myself, \"Why? Why am I doing this?\" Something was missing. I didn\u2019t want to annihilate my soul and be nothing. I wanted a relationship with the Supreme, impersonal philosophy was too dry for me. I wanted something more personal like Christianity.\n\nThis is when I met the Hare Krishnas and came to their temple. Who would have thought right? \u2026 I had seen Hare Krishnas before, dancing and singing on the streets. But I had never read about their philosophy, I thought that they are just crazy happy people. Turns out I was right, they are crazy, and they are happy. But they are crazy and happy for God. In the temple, Hare Krishna devotees introduced me to the bhakti yoga philosophy and I felt that I finally found my place\u2026 Words can\u2019t explain what I felt there. My heart was melting. It felt as if I was finally home. I won\u2019t even try to explain what experiences I had in that temple. My heart was captured, God stole my heart, and I don\u2019t think I will ever get it back\u2026\n\nNow, for the last few years, I have lived in a temple in NY and traveled all over the world, I have found my path, God called me, and I answered \u2013 I became a monk. His call was so powerful that I gave Him everything and have taken vows of celibacy.\n\nI hope that everyone will find their path. I know that God is calling everyone, He is waiting for us. Everyone has a different relationship with God. There are so many paths, but the goal is one. We are all children of God. Like rivers meet in the ocean we all will meet in His Kingdom. Yet each river is different, it has its own beauty and specialty. Each path is different, but isn\u2019t that beautiful?\n\nIf anyone has any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate and ask me privately.",

Being around people who lie manipulate or are self centered makes me so angry. And constantly having to correct the same people over the same things Is killing me. I dont want to be around anyone but that's not an option for me. Even though my anger is a direct response to how other people are behaving I'm the one labels with \"a problem\". I'm the one who needs to change. And it's unfair. I don't know what to do. All I ask is for everyone to treat others the way they would want to be treated and by trying to get everyone to see their own behavior is making everyone not want to be around me. I feel like I can call \" it\" out of people. The darkness or ego or what ever u want to call it. The parasite living within all of us. And I can't help myself but to correct it. I just want to feel normal again. I don't know who I am or what I'm even doing here. To find the answer, to see the light, to feel it within myself, then shif into this dark reality.

When you successfully do so, you regain the ability to feel euphoria all over your body and for long durations with a second practice, the selfhack, that is basically the conscious movement of your \"spiritual energy\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only is this spiritual energy the very essence of the positive emotions in the physical body it's in every thing in nature. After gaining control of this, the euphoric feeling everywhere on my body / the levels off it have just been truly ecstatic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is that positive energy that can most easily be felt/recognized as present while you get goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli. Eventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of positive energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps to  then feel it over your whole body and increase its duration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis energy has been researched and documented under many names Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Intent, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, The Tingles, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested in taking control of your energy and feel euphoria on-demand I made these [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/)  explaining how you can also use this selfhack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Everyone feels this energy at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on and those are exactly the people you can find on [r/Spiritualchills](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/) where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on how-to induce it to counteract stress or feel euphoria on-demand.",

I started to have dejavu after this day and it hasn't stopped. I have suffered anxiety and depression for a long time but after this everything got so much worse. I began to have spiritual experiences where I felt pulled internally and like something (many somethings) were talking to me inside of my mind.  I began to have flashbacks and slowly began to recall the spiritual encounter that Thanksgiving night. I lived through the book of revelations along with other biblical prophecy. I recall speaking to angels and having visions from Isaiah. I had never read these books before that night. I remember being visited by someone or something who explained my life and why everything is happening on earth and the purpose behind it all. My memories are still cloudy from that night but when I'm laying in bed late at night I'll still have memories from that night flash through my mind. When I'm going about my day to day I experience moments with others that I was told would happen but when I was told I wasn't shown who or faces just conversations. Now when it happens sometimes I'll hear a very quiet voice inside say \"this is an important moment. Remember this and who it is\". I have met one other person who has had dreams and visions like I have that are completely biblical but im still confused by it all. Its like my life is now slowly moving to the end on my vision (pure joy, happiness, love, forgiveness, and celebration) and don't know how long this will keep going on for until I experience clarity. I'm wondering if anyone has ever had or heard of something similar. Ever since this began I was pulled back to Christ and his sacrifice but before this I turned so far away from Christianity I looked almost everywhere else for answers to life to find the meaning of it all. I oddly have a sense of peace and surrender through it all yet I still wish I could go back to that night and remember the dreams vividly and remember who I was talking to clearly instead of fragmented memories.",

I had a fairly intense awakening in 2019 and it was fine for a while (unconditional love, feeling healthy and connected, new thought patterns) but soon the psychic attack started where I was relentlessly attacked by these beings, siphoning my energy every night and attacking every part of my being, leaving me a total wreck and unable to explain to my family what was going on without seeming crazy. It's hard to explain to a psychiatrist that you're being attacked by \"beings\" without being labeled a schizophrenic. Even now I'm on meds because I lost that fight. I have lost everything because of this awakening and the spiritual attacks which after 3 years haven't stopped. I'm losing steam in this fight. I was completely unprepared and vulnerable because I was only 19 when I woke up. Thank you, any advice or personal experiences so I feel less alone would be much appreciated. ",

Also this has been happening for well over almost 2 months now. So I think I got a good grip on what this is. And I\u2019m asking because I\u2019m kinda watching my whole reality crumble again.

          "content": "\nHey everyone,\n\nAbout four months ago, during a psychedelic trip, I experienced a profound revelation. It was a moment where I truly saw myself for who I am. Reflecting on my life, I realized that I've been carrying the weight of childhood trauma, which manifested in many ways. From feeling like an outsider among peers to desperately seeking love and approval, my past haunted me.\n\nMy relationship with my parents wasn't always smooth, and that added to the cloud of darkness hovering over me. I became someone who sought validation through relationships, even if it meant settling for the wrong ones. Low self-esteem and a constant need to please others guided my actions.\n\nHowever, this journey wasn't all gloom. I've started putting myself first, learning to say \"no\" without guilt, and slowly breaking free from the chains of people-pleasing. The most significant lesson I've embraced is forgiving myself and accepting that the past is just that\u2014the past.\n\nThis journey of self-reflection has been transformative. I'm now on a path of self-love, healing, and acceptance. Every step I take toward prioritizing my well-being feels like a victory. How have you navigated similar journeys of self-discovery and healing? Would love to hear your experiences and insights.",

          "content": "Hello all. I just have a quick question for you. The more I rise up in my awareness and ascension, the more \u201cawake\u201d I become, the more I am feeling energies all around me, which I know is normal and a positive sign, however I am feeling so strongly in my body the negative feelings or thoughts others might have towards me. If someone around me is upset with me about something, I know it! No matter how they act towards me I feel it physically. Some people, even people in my immediate family, when I am around them I shake, my body aches, negative thoughts start to swirl, and I feel as if Kano matter what I do, they HATE me\u2026 even if they are not saying it, it\u2019s a feeling, a vibration\u2026 so it\u2019s always right about when I\u2019m feeling great about my awakening and happy to be seeing signs and synchronicity that I\u2019m doing great\u2026 then bam.. I am around someone and I just can\u2019t help but feel like shit. Shit about myself, shitty in my body and my bones, thinking thinking thinking of what I could\u2019ve done to them to make them upset.. and I think to myself we always hear the outside world is a reflection of how we are feeling on the inside.. so is it true? Does that negative feeling come from me? And why is it only when I\u2019m around her that I feel this way? The person is my sister. I love her and she tries to be kind and usually is but I get a strong terrible feeling around her sometimes well lately most of the time. I feel ill intentions I suppose.. but I am unsure if these feelings are coming from me and she really does not have I\u2019ll feelings towards me or if she truly is just a bad seed and I don\u2019t want to admit it\u2026 Iwould like to note that I am a truly loving being.. I really just want the best for everyone including myself. Amy advice about these energies? Thanks so much",

          "content": "First I just want to give some context with my awakening experience thus far\u2026 I used to have some bad habits and I used to suffer a lot. I\u2019ve always struggled with various addictions and although in recent years I have been much better off, I still struggled with internet porn, smoking pot, numbing myself with video games and phone scrolling, eating junk food, etc. My marriage was at a boiling point and trust with my wife was blown. One day I decided to draw a card and that card was the Ten of Swords. It was basically interpreted at the time as: You\u2019re not a victim. You did this to yourself. Time to take responsibility. \n\nSometime later on, I made the decision that enough was enough. I stopped smoking pot. I gave up my smart phone for a flip phone. I started meditating daily, and things started to change. I came clean to my wife on the extent of my internet browsing habits and naturally just stopped playing video games.\n\nAt some point around this time I was directed by my teachers and guides to The Power of Now. Every single word of the book was heard and understood and that day I experienced a glimpse of awakening. I accessed \u201cthe Now\u201d and spent all day in it. It was like seeing the world for the first time again. After that day, the feeling slowly went away and since then I have been working closely with my guides on my path to an awakened life. \n\nDuring this experience I developed some level of insomnia that I found quite tough to handle at first. In time I learned to surrender and let go and have been managing much better. All of my hobbies and interests took a back seat to this process. All of my bad habits evaporated. \n\nMonths later I am at a point where I understand my addictions for what they were and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for them to come back. I have thoughts and can feel my ego trying to lure me at times but I don\u2019t believe them. Normalcy is returning in a sense, but things will never be the same. \n\nOne thing I continue to struggle with is understanding how to balance material interests with an awakened life without attachment? I feel like I\u2019m at a point where I can enjoy some of my material interests again but am unsure about a few things. I really do enjoy video games. I always have. My interest in them hasn\u2019t waned but I am hesitant to play because I feel like it is not in service of my higher self and I might be punished or something? I think ultimately I can play video games at some point again, I just need to learn of a different way to approach them. \n\nI have asked my guides through tarot a few times and seem to get mixed signals. Perhaps depending on where I\u2019m at mentally and spiritually at the time. Sometimes it\u2019s the 5 of Swords and do not pass, other times it\u2019s like do what energized and excites you!\n\nI have a fantasy hockey pool that I enjoy playing. I enjoy following my local team. I am trying to play the pool and enjoy it but without too much investment. If I\u2019m thinking about it all the time, or beating myself about a mistake or bad play, I feel like I\u2019ve lost the plot and need to take a step back and remind myself of the illusion. Is this the key? Enjoying material things but realizing that ultimately they are meaningless? Is moderation the key?\n\nHow can I get into, and follow a show I liked before? Is following and getting excited for next weeks episode not being attached? Looking forward to some upcoming down time in the future so I can relax and play video games? I guess I just don\u2019t understand how I can have a relationship with any material thing without some level of identification? Ultimately it is my personality that likes all these things?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read! I have never told anyone of my recent experience except for my wife. I would love to hear back from you all! Thank you!",

          "author": "XeRnOg-",
          "content": "Luxor is kinda somewhat real. I kinda or might have learned true psychological warfare from a voice in the air. Took a fucking while though. He kinda felt sorry for me after a while and we were slowly becoming friends so...He is the God of Psychological warfare, he can \"end\" his game when he \"wants\".  He does what he does. Why should he need a reason to teach me? Its simply just another situation. Was there ever even a game? Did anything ever start or end? And Luxor doesn't call himself a god of anything. I called him that. He said to use Luxor cause it almost sounds like...\n\nLuxor, the God of Psychological Warfare:\nLuxor as the God of Psychological Warfare keeps his existence hidden to retain his advantage.  He is the reason why Ares and Athena are always fighting.  He reveals himself only to those who endure his game.  For with his psychological warfare, it is not about winning or losing but keeping the game constantly going. Luxor has no interest in winning or losing and thus retains an advantage.  His only interest is to see if anyone can escape the prison of the mind where all conflicts start. If conflict can be resolved in the mind, then any reason for war is resolved.  Thus, he shows the illusion of war and how the mind creates conflict with labels such as enemy and opponent.\n\nAnybody who can free themselves from the labels of an advantageous situation and disadvantageous situation, free and imprisoned, slow and fast, impatient and patient, winning and losing, strong and weak, scared and courageous have freed themselves from the burden of unnecessary labels. The desire to win is suffering and the desire of not wanting to lose is suffering. All conditions are created in the mind and winning is no longer winning and losing no longer losing once it becomes clear that the mind is what creates our winning and losing.\n\nSun Tzu says that to understand your opponent leads to winning many battles but to understand yourself leads to winning all battles; however Luxor's approach is to transcend all labels of oneself and adhere to no clear definition of winning and losing and to remain in a constant state where no winning or losing occurs and to wait until the opponent himself throws away the label of opponent he has labeled you with.  He shows you the truth of war: all sides lose in a war or must win together.  Luxor will not help you escape conflict; quite the opposite. Luxor will drag you further and further into conflict and finds no fault in exploiting every psychological issue. He will make for you enemies where there are none.  \n\nHe will turn friends into enemies and enemies into friends.  Only once you remove those labels can you defeat his psychological warfare.  He will convince you that you have won the last 10 battles but then switch those labels to show you that it is the mind that creates your conflict.  It is up to you to find the key to escape the conflict within the mind.\n\nHe will oftentimes make you think you are on the verge of winning and later on, flips that label and shows how easily it can be to change a winning situation to a losing situation.  All because of a label and all because you have allowed him to seize control of the mind.\n\nIt is only once man transcends all labels will he be able to perform best.  A man not worried about winning or losing performs best in any situation for he has no end goal and lives in the moment of whatever problems arises at that time.  A man who has transcended winning and losing does exactly what is required for every situation and encounter and every problem.  Actually, the man who transcends even the problem itself and views it instead as a solution has achieved true liberation.  This is what Luxor shows.  What appears to be a winning situation can be anything a person wants it to be.  For to be at this state of equanimity means you no longer see a problem that needs to be \"won\" or \"solved\".\n\nHow can anyone beat a man who cares neither to lose nor win?  How can you imprison a man who cares neither for freedom nor imprisonment?  Those are simply conditions the mind has created.  The win or loss comes from the mind.  The freedom or cage comes from the mind.",

          "content": "I started a schizophrenic journey about 7 years or so ago. The voices were dark at first and seemed evil but over time I began to help them and they eventually apologized and said, \"we did not know we were lost in darkness. We realized now why we were attracted to you; you had a light to outshine the darkness. PLEASE! PLEASE! We did not mean to harm our light!! We did not know what we did!\"\n\nOver time, higher spiritual beings came to visit and help me. Believe what you want but when things sound so loud and clear where I could locate the sound then I'll believe what I want to believe.\n\nIts the fairest system in the world. Nobody punishes you. You get exactly what you've been looking for then get reborn in a world that was like what was in your heart .\n\nThat's it... They simply said there is One greater and this One appears in the form you need in that current moment, the form you understand and accept best but they don't know if this one is simply an all. Consciousness can be split into infinite units but there may be a one that is the entirety of this. This One is the Infinite thus it is the only one that can be real and unreal at the same time, infinite and nothing at the same time. \n\nThere is no such thing as real evil just stupidity. No one has ever said, \"I do this in the name of evil\", just \"I do this cause I want this and that.\" Then there are those people who say, \"I do this because it is the right thing to do and that is all I need to know and I will always do the right thing no matter the consequence.\" There are people who do things in the name of good but never people who do things in the name of evil. \n\nThey said evil never really existed and if it did, they're sure this system would save them too. Yea they said they know love exists so isn't that the opposite of evil or something so shouldn't it exist? The One is mysterious. The One or the All or the Infinite or the Three but never the evil. They just don't know why the Infinite doesn't have any evil but they know this Infinite is nothing but love.  \n\nThey don't know because the Infinite can never ever truly be understood but they know this One or All is good and they love everybody because some are stupid and take a while but once they are here they will finally know and feel so stupid as to why they didn't just choose love in the first place. \n\nEverybody will get here eventually as you are constantly reborn until you do. Do not worry my friend, it is not a race but a journey. Have some fun and live your life with the spiritual principles of forgiveness, faith, and love and remember to pray for the so-called \"demons\" who used to be the homeless man who had lost his mind and had already started shouting in the darkness.  They cannot find their way out and they need a light.  They died so lost that they will remain lost unless we do what should already have done while they were alive and send them all our help.\n\nThey said it is not necessary to become a scientist like the Buddha in order to ascend. Becoming a scientist like the Buddha is for those who wish to acquire knowledge of the Universe, the forces of the Universe, and how to control those forces.\n\nThey said the reason why people get reborn into the physical world is because of the physical attachments we hold onto when we die. They said this is why the Buddha said to let go of attachments or we will simply be reborn into the physical world.\n\nThey also said if you were to die right now which would you take with you? The dogma or the spiritual principles? They said your Christ was right and in one parable, he said \"you follow the law but have forgotten the spirit of it.\"  For the ones who love their dogma but instead chose the spiritual principles, why did you choose not to take the dogma? You were so adamant about the dogma but in the end chose the spiritual principles. Why? Now live those principles then if those are what you will take with you when you die for the one and all never leaves anybody and has always been there and everywhere.\n\nYour Christ even said that what you eat cannot make you unclean for the physical body cannot become spiritually unclean. It is what exists in your heart that will corrupt your spirit.\n\nThey said that do not forget that your Christ loved everybody. He did not reject the gentile. He did not reject anyone of any border or any nation. Your Christ does not belong to Christianity.  If your Christ is truly in your heart does that mean his name or the example he lead by? The spirit or the letter?\n\nThey said its a lot of stories because faith was never good enough for some people. And sometimes stuff gets put in by whoever was in control.  There are some people that instead of wanting faith love and forgiveness needed a God to reward them and punish those they did not like. Some people can only feel they are good if they label someone else as the lesser or evil. Some people are simply like that they only feel they are good if they exist higher than everybody else and feel they are so much better than everybody else; the need to feel so special is great that their god somehow wants exactly what they want. There are always those people like that that has existed in every era.  \n\nBut that is not good; that is simply wanting to feel special. Is it what you profess with your tongue or do with your heart?  The tongue can lie but what exists in your heart will never lie and what is within the heart the body will follow. No the flesh is not weak, it was simply within your heart this whole time.  Is a dog a dinosaur if they call it a dinosaur?\n\nThey said how is it true faith if you have simply followed the faith of the crowd? If you followed the faith of those before your Christ was born,  would you have made it to a spiritual resurrection? True faith is to follow the faith of the One by finding the principles yourself.  Simply because a crowd is bigger does not make it valid. For if you know in your heart that your principles are right, then your faith will be bigger than that of the crowd.\n\nThey said that to have true faith is to open your reality up to an infinite number of outcomes thus guaranteeing success but you must eliminate all expectations and trust that the Universe has much bigger plans than your meager expectations. You simply need to have faith; you do not need to have faith in anything and so simply having it is enough.\n\nThey said this is why living with hate or negative emotions will always lose in the end because hate or negative emotions does not have the infinite outcomes that love and faith has and that the last eventual outcome of hate is destruction.\n\nRemember the frail lady who gave her last coin to the collection box and even though the rich man gave more, your Christ said she gave more. Why is that? Does your Christ really concern himself with money? She gave more because she gave her entire heart and soul to your Christ.",

Also without desires/wants, regardless of if they're good or bad, then what's the point of striving to do anything?\n\nI also want to point out I understand there are \"good\" and \"bad\" levels of attachment, but I guess my problem is that when I see such statements being made it's sounds like they're implying that ALL attachment, desires, etc... lead to suffering which I just cant agree with or at least see the logic of that thinking.\n\nI'm fully aware that maybe I'm not understanding something basic here so please share your insights as well!",

I was the leader in this project as my business was hosting this student teacher. \n\nAs a person in both spiritual and corporate leadership, I\u2019m constantly seeking personal continuous improvement in both positive and negative feedback. This person was unreceptive to taking accountability and used \u201cmirroring\u201d a new age technique to deflect any thought provoking questions that they may also be in the wrong. \n\nAs a caveat in this conversation as the coach to the student, I gave many examples how ego can creep in even for teachers/ coaches , that we\u2019re all still students and we have to acknowledge and move forward. \n\nHere\u2019s where the kicker came in when I asked if the student was open to feedback, any feedback that I suggested looking into that they didn\u2019t like, the mirror method was used to then say I actually had to heal. \n\nSo the big question is. Am I the only teacher out there that feels  people are misusing the mirror method as a gaslight technique to deflect on others when they don\u2019t want to look at things that they don\u2019t want to work on? \n\nSide note I think the mirror method can work in some scenarios if not abused. From my experience I tend to see the overuse and reliance on it for everything distracts oneself from self reflection. \n\nFor myself personally, I avoid mirror\nMethod because I believe each person has their own unique individual energy and they can control what they put out in the world. I rarely see it as a pass or fail method. If some people choose to ignore others well being to self serve that\u2019s on them. I learned to take accountability because the latter never ends well.

          "content": "Felt separated from my body\n\nHey all, I just had a really interesting meditation. (I'm new to meditating, trying a lot of different types). But tonight I went outside in the dark and sat on the patio and really felt different. Just focusing on hearing the wind, feeling the breeze, etc., when I started feeling vibrating. I have felt it before just not this intensely. It started right around my torso. Then I found I could move the vibrations up my body and the next thing I knew it had fully enveloped me. It felt nice but I decided to dismiss the sensation and move back to just focusing on breathing and feeling. That's when things got strange.  \n\n\nAbout 10 or so breaths into it, I started noticing my heartbeat. Feeling it. Every little thump. Then I took that focus to my breathing. And all of a sudden I notice, I'm feeling two different breathing patterns. There's the breathing \"I'\" am doing, and then faintly back there I feel the body taking it's breaths. The \"two\" breathing patterns were probably a half a second apart or less but I could notice it. It felt like \"I\" was, not hovering, but maybe detached about six inches above the breathing happening below. I didn't feel like I was floating but I felt like at that moment there were two \"me\"s.  \n\n\nAnyone else had this experience? Or is it just a hangover from the anesthesia I had about 12 hours ago for my colonoscopy lol? No, but seriously it felt like a true out-of-body experience.",

I had 2 people in my life to i could open up about what im going through but now it seems there is even slight aggression towards me if bring up, for example, encounters during meditation, or chakras opening  up at the same time, these considering about my experiences. Around 10 years ago i encountered entities or aliens in my life and about 1 year they followed me doing all kind of tests, keeping me awake many nights in a row etc. Overall it was not a pleasant encounter with them. Theres even some memory blackouts related to that time. I  Suffered years from severe anxiety and panic attacs after that, recovered and this year has been my year of blooming, theres even saying that it may take 10 years to reach that one year that makes the whole difference in our lives. (The encounter was my wakeup call) This year ive been 9months without medication, 6months sober, 3months without nicotine and lost 11kg and i keep going. Made inner peace with everyone i had grudge, theres not much anything that i find annoying anymore, feels like i made some real progress, theres even direct connection with some energy during my meditations and it feels warm and good, different from what was with those aliens. Theres some instant reactions in my life and sudden adjustment if its karma related issue. But now it seems that im all alone with this, theres No one anymore to talk to, those 2 close people in my life that used to listen and understand have been turning cold shoulder and i have not even been speaking these related stuff anymore, just sometimes i mention but get instant regrets. This is just me venting really because sometimes i feel like i can take the world all by myself but then again sometimes i feel powerless and all alone with my journey...ive read there are many like me but i havent had the guts to come forward to anyone.",

I tried sun gazing for the first time and it was a surreal experience. \n\nOnce I got through the sensitivity the pain and watery eyes I saw the sun in its entirety for the first time and it was beautiful. To actually see the sun itself without pain. For the record, it wasn't noon or midday. It was probably an hour before sunset. The sun wasn't as bright but it was still pretty effing bright. \n\nIt literally felt like the light from the sun coming in was pushing the dark out of my head and out of my mouth until there was nothing left. And I could stare at the sun without pain For almost 10 seconds before stopping. Not because it would hurt I just didn't want to press my luck. \n\nThere was a purple spot In my vision that shrank throughout the rest of the day before disappearing of course. But the biggest result I felt was the my third eye feeling so intense. I kept rubbing That's spot all day trying to soothe it Because I felt like it was giving me a migraine.\n\nBut my face felt so much lighter afterwards. And I wouldn't have done this if I wasnt guided by my Ancestors, Angels, Whoever it is on the other side i've been communicating with for years. It felt like a leap of faith moment.\n\nI'm not advocating anyone else try sun gazing as it is dangerous of course. But if any of you do just use extreme caution. I think I started out too big and deep down I knew that, but I think that's where the leap of faith came in. \n\nStarting that early I think was just for my journey. So if any of you do do it, again, be smarter than I was lol. But I am 100% doing this again. I don't see how I could Ever go back.",

          "content": "The markers of spiritual awakening are not meant to be experiences, yet experiences mark spiritual awakening.  This is not a contradiction or paradox.  Both are true at the same time.\n\nSpir means breath, and Rituals are processes in and out, down and up, round and round.  E in Latin means 'out of.'  Volution means circling a center.  Evolution is the process to turn in a circle, or cyclic time and experience.  What determines the changed states from evolution?  Seek, Find and Adaptation.  Breathing is more than simple breath in and out.\n\n**From Shingon Texts of China**\n\n>The masters kept the esoteric meaning to themselves and, conforming to the oral teachings, concealed the real teaching in their minds, while their disciples pursued their studies and conducted discussions in accordance with the tenets of their schools.\n\nThe exoteric teaching of meditation is to watch the breath.  The esoteric teaching is telling what the breath is and how this relates to expanding the mind by experiences in life and self-reflection inside the mind.  I will attempt to outline this by our current context, but you can also check the links in my profile.  It's all I talk about.  To accomplish this, I will speak in metaphor, then you must decode the meaning with inner sight.  This is how it works.  Symbolism is the higher form of letters, words, paragraphs and finally meaning.\n\n**Esoteric Breath Work**\n\nThere are two primary languages used to teach divinity.  Hebrew is the language of the Father and Son in the wilderness (exoteric).  Sanskrit is called, \"The Great Mother.\"  Spirit is the mother giving birth from inside out.  The first breath you receive as a child is the breath of God, or consciousness breathing in air when consciousness emerges from the womb (breathes you out into the light).\n\nWhen you are a baby, you take in milk (symbolism for baby food).  When you are a young soul, you do the same, but with outer experiences.  As a baby grows, it eventually eats real food.  When a soul grows beyond experiences, it eats real knowledge.  Both experience and meaning are necessity.  Seek, Find and Adaptation.\n\nBreath work in meditation is watching what you eat, think, feel and express out as breathe out on others.  Yoga is yoking, or unity with others.  Adam knew eve, and they had intercourse.  You are reading my words, and my words are intercourse between you and my mind.  I am breathing out, and you are breathing in.  What you do with this information is your own work and practice of awakening dormant parts of your knowledge already present.  You are already full.  The trick here is to awaken what's already there.\n\nNow do you see what awakening means?  Spiritual practice.  Practice your breath and evolve.  In Latin, Ec means, 'out of.'  Stasis means rest, or stillness.  Ecstasy is the ecstatic state of Samadhi reached in meditation.  You stop the breathing, empty out and stillness reveals your identity and nature to you.\n\n\\-**Meditation** is Emptying Out\n\n\\-**Contemplation** is Outside In (like this post)\n\n\\-**Service** is Inside Out, or breathing on others with your new fresh breath. To awaken this breath, you cleanse it.\n\nCycling the breath (volution) is emptying out, breathing in and breathing out.  Watch your breath!\n\nOnce you do this well, you then bring experiences of kindness, love and compassion to others in the outer world.  Inner to outer, or giving birth to goodness.\n\n**Brah** (expanding) **Man** (Mind).  Brahman is the creator God of the Hindus.  Man is the mind, or the one thinking, a copy of Brahman.  Eternally forever breathing.  Immortal.  The breath, once given, is never taken away.  Life is Light and Mind from experiences expanding both.\n\nNow you know. Once you know, you cannot unknow.\n\n1 Corinthians 3:16 King James Version 16 **Know ye not that ye are the temple of God**, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\n\nAll scriptures tell the same story.  Hidden in the esoteric, but expressed by the experiences of the exoteric.  Both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I don't mind working a stable job and being a good daughter but I see people who are wild and adventurous and free and I feel like I am missing out. I have anxiety so maybe it's just that desire to overcompensate to operate at an average level (whatever that means). But I once dated an enlightened man and know that this is all I ever want. Why settle for a constricted life filled with lies and inflated egos and bias when you can experience cosmic unconditional love??  \n\nOne that binds. I know nothing is perfect. I love my family. But I've been hurting for far too long. I've done everything I've been told since i was a kid. At the detriment of developing a sense of self or healthy boundaries. Where im from talking back or going against authority is very disrespectful. My parents never really listened to my preferences e.g wear this, run for president of this club etc. Now I want to hold off and travel and go for spiritual retreats and heal, find myself and not jump into marriage and pop out a kid. But I'm scared they won't understand. I was raised strict catholic and my mom is already pushing her coworkers son on me whom I've never met. \n\nI feel sad and depressed inside. But I try not to think about it. Sometimes I wish my family would dissappear so I can actually be free. Because I know everything I want will be talked down on or they'll say I'm too young and i should listen to my elders etc. I've seen my parents and aunts' marriages. I think I'm making the best decision here.. Just a little scared and alone in my thoughts.",

I've had a long difficult struggle with mental health problems and I was raised my a narcissist mum which has left me with deep rooted issues. I've battled Substance abuse, suicidal thoughts, low self esteem and worth, incredible self cruelty and negative thinking for most of my life. It's only this last few months that I've been able to start to make changes but I feel like I really asked for it and I got it. I keep talking to this picture of my grandma, she treat me like a daughter and gave me a mother's love, she died two years ago. I was just chatting away to her and I said \"I'm really making progress grandma, I know u will say stop that waccy baccy and I will, I will, just give me time\" I walked away and coughed and coughed and brought up some nasty phlegm sorry for the over share, and then I looked at her picture in the kitchen and I thought you bugger. Cause I'm now sat here and I can bring myself to pick up the rest of my joint. It's like I know I'm done. What is this what's happened?? \n\nA lot of signs were appearing for me lately too angel numbers, coincidences, repeated dreams and it's been like the universe has been helping me along. \n\nI'm not used to feeling this happy and driven what is going on? \nI've also been no contact with my narc mum for five weeks and I've been educating myself on narcissistic abuse. I have found this really freeing and helpful.\n\nI just feel like my life is changing but it's feels deeper than that like sometimes I feel my whole body vibrate with energy. If you've read this far thankyou so much if you can help me understand and that I'm not just going crazy I'd be most grateful. X\n\nEdit I've been building up an exercise routine lately too something I've never ever stuck to in the past and I'm really enjoying it. I'm so happy but so baffled by this sudden change in behaviour x\n\nAnother edit: I went through an incredibly dark period prior to this sudden change, it felt like a low dark point in my life like I properly hit my rock bottom then boom, it's like I'm alive and buzzing but scared of myself and this new feeling.",

They're portals to other realms where we can go through some deeply transformative experiences.  \n\n\nI just wrote an article about the different levels of a psychedelic trip, and the different applications we can gain from them, whether it be healing, spiritual growth, wisdom etc. To the complete interdimensional travel that you might have experienced and what it means.  \n\n\nI hope you enjoy this content, because I sure had fun writing it.

Leading up to her death (from illness) she was in the hospital, so we as a family knew she was nearing the end of her life. I was out of state and did not get to physically see her or say our goodbyes. She passed away around 2am one night while I was sleeping. I did not find out she passed till I awoke the following morning. Though, that night my dream was far beyond any dream I experienced ever before. In said dream it was a short visualization rather than a long chain of events that occurred. Anyway, I recall sitting on the side on Sari's hospital bed, the room was bright and yellow. It did not feel like a hospital room in the sense of being sterilized, cold and lonely. It was warming. There was an open window, revealing bright skies and luscious shrubs just outside the room. On the nightstand next to her bed was a vase of blue hydrangeas. This is significant because for as long as I can remember, she had numerous hydrangea bushels planted in her yard that had always stood out to me. Sitting on the hospital bed with her I don't recall actually looking up and seeing her, though feeling her presence knowing she was sitting right next to me.  Immediately when I woke in the morning, I felt that the described dream was deeper and intense than all other dream I've had. Soon after is when I found out she passed that night. I was shaken to my core but overcome with a sense of enlightenment, truly and deeply feeling that this experience was her saying goodbye to me as she passed on. This event has brought me much peace as I feel she consciously experienced one last moment together, just as I did in that same point in time, in space, in somewhere. I am curious if anyone else has had an experience as such or if there's even a term for it. I do not soley perceive this as just a visitation dream, as the same time I was having this dream she was passing on. And as I said, I felt that she somehow was aware of this interdimensional interaction we had that night. Thanks for reading. :)",

You are the force that is moving them. The fingers obey your intent. Intent is the true you, and it's that force that is moving everything.  \n\n\n  \nYou are that force that manifests itself in the universe. The first manifestation of that force is light, or energy, which is the same thing, and everything is created through this energy. Scientists will even tell you that everything is made of energy.  \n\n\n  \nYou can give whatever explanation you want: \"Oh, my brain, my nerves...\" But if you go for the truth, the force that moves your fingers is the same force that makes you dream; it's the same force that opens a flower, or moves the wind, or creates a tornado, or makes the stars move throughout the universe, or makes electrons move around atoms.  \n\n\n  \nFor example: I experienced moving myself out to successfully astral project when I realized that, I don't move my physical body, only my intention by tapping into what feels like my body but just \"lighter\" with my intent to move that.  \n\n\n  \nIt is your vital force, the animating force behind life itself, has always been associated with both breath and air in cultures that have experienced with it then documented this occurence. It can also be observed as hot or cold.  \n\n\n  \nThis is the equivalent to what can be considered your \"Spiritual energy\".  \n\n\n  \nHere's a simple definition that can explain its spiritual expression: it is that blissful wave that can most easily be felt/recognized as present while you experience goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli.  \n\n\n  \nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps. Everyone can activate it but not everyone is aware that there is some sort of energy current flowing when they get goosebumps. Getting goosebumps is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the euphoric feeling you can feel over your whole body or the many positive benefits that controlling your spiritual energy can bring you.  \n\n\n  \nIt has been researched and documented under many names Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Intent, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.   \n\n\n  \nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) that will introduce you to this energy, help you feel it on command and benefit from its control.  \n\n\n  \nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on and those are exactly the people you can find on r/spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on how-to induce it to counteract stress or feel ecstasy on-demand.",

Look at what we eat, watch, wear, smell, listen to, read and other activities, all input given to mind through five senses and today we are repeating these activities consciously even when we know that this freedom of choice is enslaving us to our mind's mundane requirements of the physical mental satisfaction. And how does it damage us? By making us physically and mentally dependent so badly that we crave these things. All the wrong information on product packaging, internet and media advertisement, false news, horrifying actions of the leaders and countries, ignorance of the masses, and many more reasons to mislead us by example is out there.

I have recorded on reddit what I feel was my enlightenment and subsequent ascension as well as other related non sense prior to and after these experiences.\n\nSince, I have been sharing an equation that I put to the whole experience that I feel was divinely inspired, find myself making outrageous claims and even opening up a sub in harmony with a life long dream of making a difference.\n\nThis is where you come in, I have been asking/inviting as many of you who would like to come have a look at the equation and related non sense. The response thus far has been beyond any expectation, I am grateful to any who would come investigate with me so that we both might raise ourselves up for having done so.\n\nI have posted a new thread in my sub asking for folks to participate in a *social consciousness experiment* of a philosophical/scientific/spiritual nature. I am asking that you give consideration to my non sense as I am not interested in your money nor whether you choose not to take a look or participate. I am looking to gather more data to proof whether or not the claims I find myself making have merit or has this whole thing been folly.\n\nThere are no rules for participation other than incorporating some of the practices in to your own work, especially the \"Tesla Ritual\" to connect you to \"God\" or Spirit. A simple hey I am in and I am planning on doing this, will report back whenever would be perfect.\n\nPut on your curious/skeptic cap should you choose to take a look. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\n[Jailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/liberment/comments/17gipz8/jailbreak/) \\- 1st thread, equation, explanation + practices.\n\n[A request for more data](https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/17rmfdf/a_philosophicalscientificspiritual_request_for/) \\- S.C.E thread where you can jump in and let us know you are participating. \n\n\\*Note\\* This is not an advertisement, I am not interested in your money.

I went through a long hard road of acceptance of it all and thought the only way was to accept and never found a way when I was asleep. during my journey I have encountered many supernatural and spiritual things such as communicating with spirits, encountering spirit orbs by the thousands and even when I think of them, I also have a very strong connection to the spirit realm I can feel its energy and mine together I can even make ppl feel it by the touch if I am channeled to it. Iam also an empath and I care about the consciousness of all living things. when I finally awakened, I know exactly what Iam and why Iam here the experience was like all the fears and negative energy was purged from my body and my breath was taken away as my mind felt light and my heart felt this unconditional love that I feel every time, I connect to the spirit realm. a buzzy feeling and makes me jitter sometimes lol. I can literally feel the energy as i push it through my body into my hands .and sometimes I can make others feel it by the touch or even from distance. being awake I now realize that Iam one with the light and the light is with me and i chose to come here on this earth to experience these hardships to grow spiritually and to have the chance to do what I always wanted  and that was to share my love and care to the world to shine the light in this dark world to show empathy to all those who think no one cares to guide those who are lost to just care :) I'm here simply because I care and before I came here to live this life i wanted the chance to do just that\n\nit is my destiny, and I will walk through the fire and flames for anyone in the physical world and to walk the shadows of death for all living things for all eternity I will be there in afterlife guiding lost souls and to make sure everyone makes their way to fulfillment Iam here for everyone.

I've recently lost my older sister this year and although I'm sad she's gone, everyone is much more relaxed and not having to walk on eggshells around a woman with an explosive temper over the tiniest things. I've always been in a cross with my faith in well, everything. Growing up, my sister was my biggest most aggressive bully. We were both extremely overweight when we were kids all the way into out 20s. So of course at school I got ridiculed and harassed mostly by the boys but I had a tomboyish demeanor. Well at home I got not only made fun of by my heavier older sister but she yould spit on me and claw my skin til the skin would break and tell me to shut up any time I spoke so safe to say school was more of a getaway for me. I had 2 boys very young by 2 extremely older guys taking advantage of me at such a vulnerable age. I was 17, dropped out of school and extinguished both of those sperm doners so I was left with only my parents and sister to judge and look down on me wanting to keep my kids. They told me I had no maternal instincts and was wasted talent. I was feeding my youngest a bottle when my sister unprovoked said\" the day you call yourself that boys mother Hell will freeze over. I took a plastic box of baby wipes and finally snappedand kamikazied that thing right between her eyes HARD! left a good bruise i do say. Well i eventuallyhad enough of the abuse so i did what i thoughtwas right and signed guardianship over to my awesome yet meek mother. I fell in love with a man named David and lived with him happily for some time. My best friend of 19 years eventually sabatoged my relationship causne she was always jelly and later moved in with him. I lost my shit, got thrown in prison for 2 years and 2 months before i got out the bitch shot and killed David...and got away with it..WTF?!? That was 7 years ago today. Im now 33 back with all my kids includingraising one of my sisters and im still somewhat in shock. I started listening to the voices in my head and is it not only God the creator but also his counterpart. .  They tell me do not be torn. You are part of both of us God and the Devils child.  That's the natural law of polarity. 50 /50 it just IS. Stop beating yourself up for giving into the flesh every so often it's in your dna. You need to feel both sides of the equation to fully awaken",

I\u2019ve gone through rough patches before in my life, but this by far seems the worse. I\u2019ve felt closer and closer to ending it all each day. I\u2019m in therapy, have a job, on anti depressants. I\u2019ve spent the past year doing all the things you\u2019re supposed to do. And while I\u2019m not opposed to advice, I\u2019m really looking for stories any of you have experienced coming out of a dark time like this? I am so, so far away from hope that I will ever get better or find a partner and live the life I want to be living. And I know I need hope more than anything. Has anyone overcome something similar?\n\nThank you",

          "content": " Join Us\n\nDear Fellow Seekers of Ascension\n\nWe stand at the precipice of a momentous opportunity \u2013 a collective shift in consciousness that holds the promise of a world united in love and peace. On November 11, we invite you to join us in the 11:11 Manifestation event, a sacred convergence of our intentions and energies to mold a brighter future for our world.\n\n**The Power of Visualization:**\n\nIn the art of manifestation, our thoughts and intentions serve as the sculptor's tools, shaping the malleable quantum field of the human collective consciousness. On this day, let us harness the immense power within ourselves to paint a vivid mental image of a planet bathed in unity and love. But don't stop at mere imagery; dive deep into the emotional currents of this vision, imagine the feelings and emotions that saturate a world finally at peace.\n\n**The Quantum Effect:**\n\nOur thoughts ripple through the tapestry of existence, not only altering our individual paths but also influencing the collective destiny of humanity. As Humans, we possess a unique role in this cosmic drama. Our collective intent can move mountains, bend time, and foster a profound transformation in the very fabric of reality.\n\n**Shift in Timelines:**\n\nOur efforts are not limited to mere thoughts; they extend to the realm of possibilities and timelines. Every positive, love-infused intention is like a beacon illuminating a path towards a more harmonious world. By focusing our collective energy on love and unity, we can guide our planet toward a timeline where the vibration of peace resonates with unparalleled clarity.\n\n**A Path to 4th Density Love Consciousness:**\n\nOur destination is the 4th Density love consciousness, a realm where love and harmony reign supreme within our perception of reality. To get there, we must work together, aligning our intentions, and becoming vessels of positive change in this world. The 11:11 Manifestation event is a step on this cosmic journey \u2013 a chance for us to come together as a powerful force for good.\n\n**How to Participate:**\n\nOn November 11, find a quiet space, free from distractions. Close your eyes and take several deep breaths. Visualize a world where love and unity are the guiding principles. Feel the warmth, the compassion, and the serenity that envelops this world. Stay in this state for as long as you feel called to, channeling your energy and intention into this vision.\n\n**The Future is in Our Hands:**\n\nWe are the architects of our own destiny, the caretakers of Earth's future. On 11:11, let us unite in purpose, transcending the boundaries of time and space to create a world of love and unity. The power of collective manifestation is in our hands, and together, we can shape a brighter tomorrow.\n\nIn unity, In love and Light!",

          "score": 14,
          "author": "Vib_ration",
          "content": "This can be simply explained in three parts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe brain being a receiver and a transmitter of frequency is the first concept.\n\nThe frequency that you're transmitting from your brain can pass through anything because it basically is like a radio transmitter but has a unique characteristic. Which is that the frequency that your brain transmits can instantaneously be picked up at the exact same moment by another human brain on the opposite end of the planet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomething that happens to me every so often and most of you probably experienced, during your sleep, you dream about someone that you haven't heard of in a while only to wake up to realize they not only called or texted you but they were undoubtedly thinking of you! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond concept is the Law of attraction, which says, whatever frequency you emit, that exact same frequency will be drawn to you. There will be a magnetic pull. And this is a scriptural principle. For those of you who are Christians, Jewish, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists. All these books teach very similar Concepts. What you sow, also you reap. When you put out a frequency the Law of attraction says it must come back. And it will be based on whatever frequency that your brain, emotions and electromagnetic field put out. It will attract back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe third concept is how to consciously do this.\n\nSelf-induced goosebumps, from positive stimuli, allows you to take 100% control of your transmitter. When activating this, you consciously use your transmitter to attract whatever intention, narrative, thought and emotions that are present when consciously activating your self-induced goosebumps as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoosebumps is just the physical reaction, but underneath it, there's a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as frequency/energy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps and even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural euphoria and master it to the point of controlling its duration. Learning how to separate that euphoria from your physical reaction of goosebumps is the key to benefit from your transmitter and the other many positive physical and spiritual usages that gaining control of this will bring you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found many names for this Energy like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you would like to know how to activate this at will, here are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) to help you fully control your Spiritual Chills and how its an important ingredient for the law of attraction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on [r/spiritualchills](https://www.reddit.com/r/spiritualchills/) where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",

          "content": "For a long while I've had the uncanny suspicion that wild birds in the trees can sense my energy, but it's only gotten more clear and now I can't ignore it.\n\nSpecifically, when my energy is agitated or anxious, the birds chirp. So reliable is the correlation that I wondered if I was hearing them chirping in my head. Today I had caffeine which makes me anxious and agitated, and was in a meditation session and it was going surprisingly well inspite of the caffeine hindrance (due to some additional changes to my practice), and I could feel my shushumni open up in a way that never happens when I'm agitated or have caffeine in me.\n\nI could very clearly feel, and also deduce, the lack of agitation and tension I would otherwise expect, and I got into that deep stillness and the stiffness that covers your body when you enter it, which felt very blocky and thick due to the stimulated energy from the caffiene.\n\nAnd so in the delicate balance of attention on the spine, which was the major change to my practice now, I could feel clearly when there was a constriction in my central channel, and an arising of agitation, and it wasn't just that the birds chirping was again in perfect and uncanny correlation with this, it's also that the intensity of the chirping matched the degree of agitation.\n\nI got a very clear, and kind of scary and bewildering sense that birds can literally sense my energy through my shushumni or spinal column, from a distance and respond to agitation in it.\n\nThis might be due to them sensing the threat of a predator in the vicinity, through the sensing of stimulated energy and agitation in a still presence. This only happens at night btw. So it could be they are relying on non visual sensory input to detect animals on the hunt. Or it might be due to my long standing focus on them. Or some other reason.\n\nIn short, birds can sense my energy. And they chirp annoyingly to let me know I'm constricted, and agitated, which usually comes as a result of caffiene, but also otherwise.",

Of course it is FALSE faith !\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\n\n\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70Another pretty significant percentage, believe with all their being that their lives are messed up and full of suffering or just don't have what they want, all going wrong because of ancestral legacies, what their ancestors did, or even themselves in previous lives.\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\n\n\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4cOf course they are right too, it is their truth and their faith that operate according to very well established laws, and manifests itself in their lives exactly according to faith. A FALSE belief in this case as well!\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\n\n\u2763\u2763\u2763Another percent of humanity believes in priests, clairvoyants, measurements with ansa, gloomy predictions, sin, in therapists who \"cleanses and erase them from the energies they contain\", in\nremains, etc. And of course they are right too, it is their truth, their faith, and man is made according to faith! A FALSE belief, too.\u2763\u2763\u2763\n\n\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9eThere is still one percent that are totally bulversed. After half of their lives they put their hope in the priests and the church, they began to understand a little more and turned to different therapists, to read something other than the classical prayers or to be in a constant search after their truth had been shattered and I don't know why to cling to anymore. These people have suffered the most because they don't know what to believe and what the truth is\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\n\n\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14People praying to a white bearded God who sits on a throne in heaven and watches their actions and writes them in a catastrophe. Who are waiting to be punished for their actions or compensated. Of course it's a FAKE attitude and in the case of these people, it's a chaos and a mess in their lives that they don't know where to go.\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n\n\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0fThere is still a percentage, of those people who... they don't think very much about what they are looking for in their lives, who they are and why they are here, they see their life on earth\ndoing unconsciously things, life has not been hit so hard that they start looking or understanding that they are more than what they know they are, \"sleeping\" still and live their lives strictly based on momentary pleasures and guided by the 5 senses.\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\n\n\ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6As I have said in many posts, everyone, in everything they do, they use the power within themselves, the God within, they use the mind of God, some consciously or unconsciously, some doing things useful and that help them develop/elevate their souls and mentally, or not!\nRegardless of what category you fall into, I'm telling you;\nYou don't need anyone or anything! But you and the God inside you that exists whether you know it or not.\nYou do not need to go to anyone to do the work you came to this life for.\nNo one can do your work, your spiritual work, whether you're aware of it or not!\nEverything you need exists inside you,\ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udef6\n\n\n\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18\ud83e\udd70you just need to get to know it. Yes, you can ask for the help of a facilitator, of a mentor who has been where you are, (1 personally confess that I have passed all the stages listed above) strictly to help you understand how you work and to give you helpful tools, but... WORK THIS A TA!\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18\ud83e\udd70\n\n\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17You are directly responsible for this and it depends on you if you prolong your \"agony\", if you continue to have false beliefs that slow down or complicate even your life situations, whatever they may be.\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\n\n\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc83You are the master of your own life and it depends on you how you want to do things.\nThere is a huge difference between giving your power to someone, putting your hope in someone else than your inner God and letting yourself be helped/guided, how to reach that power.\n\nBelieve with all your being in yourself and the God within, and never in anything else or anyone else.\n\nDo not give the \"switch\" of your light  someone else, because it will depen on when the \"bulb\" will turn on or not.\nand the God within, and never in anything else or anyone else.\nLearn to flick the switch and master the switch.\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc83\n\n\ud83c\udf39\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udc96SRI\ud83d\udc96SRI\ud83d\udc96SRI\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf39",

My question is for anyone who knows how to interpret these. While I was in the trip I sat with my eyes closed in my own mind and in my head I could clearly see a plague doctor. He looked creepy but I didn\u2019t feel scared. After I saw him he then disappeared and I saw a very large tree which I believe was a Native American/shamanic tree. Does anyone have any idea what these two things could symbolise, mainly the plague doctor\u2026 it\u2019s taken me over a week to actually fully realise that it was a plague doctor and now I\u2019m so intrigued to work out what it could mean/symbolise because in my conscious mind I\u2019ve never thought about them before. \n\nAny ideas would be appreciated!",

Hope it's helpful!  \nFrom pre-school and into our professional lives, we\u2019ve been conditioned to follow a meticulously structured path to success\n\n\u2705Spend years in school\n\n\u2705Obtain a degree\n\n\u2705Commit to a career for decades\n\nTo deviate from this path seems fraught with risk and uncertainty\n\nBut once we get to the end of the line and realize we\u2019re on a career track that doesn\u2019t fit with who we are, we face uncharted territory\n\nWe believe change requires a meticulously planned, low-risk, step-by-step blueprint\n\nBut there are no cookie-cutter approaches after this point\n\nAs Einstein wisely put it:\n\n\u201cYou cannot solve a problem with the same mind that created it.\u201d\n\nFor those at the edge, realizing your career isn't your calling, my advice is to adopt a new mindset:\n\n\u274cYou DON\u2019T NEED TO KNOW all the steps\n\n\u2705You JUST NEED TO KNOW THE NEXT step\n\nThis approach eases pressure IMMENSELY, provides all the necessary clarity, and empowers you to forge your own path\n\nYou begin to see a new way of navigation - where by simply taking the step in front of you, each ensuing step reveals itself in perfect time\n\nThings just tend to work out without meticulous interference or elaborate planning\n\nI struggled for years, but once I focused ONLY on the next step - leaving my career to pursue my artistic calling - I found clarity and peace\n\nThe ensuing structure became self-evident, each step revealing itself in perfect time without me needing to plan it all out\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been able to define my life by what I love and who I authentically am\n\nIf I can do it, you can too!",

Ever since the breakup I\u2019ve been working on my myself and being more present and open minded about things. 7 months later (now) I can definitely say I\u2019m not the same person I was back when we were dating. I can\u2019t really explain the change, it\u2019s like I feel more mature. I\u2019ve been meditating and enjoying being outdoors. Like I\u2019m looking at life in a much different way than I used to. My friends say I\u2019m going through a spiritual journey but I\u2019m not sure. Looking back 7 months later I can honestly say the relationship ended because of me and my insecurities. Anyway, last month I started seeing 11:11,1:11,2:22,3:33,4:44,5:55 pretty frequently and coincidentally. Today I had a dream about my ex, I thought nothing of it. I had some errands to run before work so I decided to go to the store. While I was there I coincidentally saw 2 items that related to the relationship. 1 item was something I gifted him for his graduation, the other item I saw was something he gave me for my birthday. Mind you I wasn\u2019t looking for these items I just happened to stumble upon them. When I was leaving the store parking lot I saw my old car I owned when I met him last November (I have a different car now) but the car I had when I met him is pretty rare, I never see it on the road. Are these signs he\u2019s coming back or am I just crazy?",

Didn't think of coming to Reddit earlier and I've been needing a place where I can bounce ideas off of others in a similar position to mine. In reading a few posts, it seems I've found the place.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone here has found low-risk ways to broach \"awakening\" topics with others when you're not sure where they're at on their journey. There are a lot of people in my life who I could see potentially \"getting\" where I'm at, and I also definitely know of a few who I can currently talk to and share with. Sometimes though, in social situations, I find it challenging to have conversations with others because all I want to talk about is \"real\" things - spirituality, what's really happening, bigger issues etc. I want to test the waters with other people but I'm sure you've all experienced the reactions (faces) you sometimes get. Two questions:\n1) have you found a way to have normal conversations in social situations without it depleting your energy from trying to mask, basically?\n2) have you found a low-risk way to test whether a person you're talking to might be interested in having a more meaningful conversation*?\n\n*I find so much value in hearing other people's beliefs and experiences. Part of my motivation here is to get them talking and sharing with me. The bigger goal is to share with one another and each take something illuminating from the conversation.\n\nAnd lastly - we had a party on the weekend and I mostly tried to observe and enjoy, but got kind of cornered into \"what have you been up to?\" convos a few times. I freeze up in these situations now because I am more averse to small talk and \"putting on a face\" than ever and also, I actually want to share what's been happening with me. But I spent a lot of time saying things like, \"I know I sound crazy,\" \"I am unable to have normal conversations anymore,\" \"I'm finding it hard to relate to humans\" and so on, which is, you know... not great.",

          "author": "I_sometimesneedhelp",
          "content": "Is it normal to dream for days about your future?\n\nSo about a 2 years ago, I had a decision to make about my living situation, my rent went up and I wasn\u2019t too sure if I could afford it so I started looking at new places to move into. What\u2019s weird is I asked myself a question, or my \u201chigher self\u201d a question asking \u201cwhat\u2019s going to happen if I move out of my current place\u201d yknow a normal question to ask yourself lol as I actually really liked it there, I didn\u2019t want to move. \nAny how back to the question. Every night since I asked myself that question, I dreamed about my future of \u201cwhat would happen if I moved out\u201d the dreams were kinda telling me not to move out of this is what will happen. But I did anyway. Because I thought it was just anxiety dreams about moving and that it wouldn\u2019t ACTUALLY happen bit by bit. But it indeed did... Bit. By. Bit\u2026 \nI dreamed every time I had a nap or went to bed in 2021 for about 1 or 2 whole months, about everyday in my future of what would happen if I moved, so every time I had a nap and went to bed for 2 months or whatever, I \u201cwoke up\u201d as it was a new day in my future at the new places I moved into. I woke up in my dreams.. if that makes sense..I didn\u2019t actually think it was going to happen bit by bit.. \nbut it is..\nAnd why I say \u201cis\u201d right now, is because I am literally, legitimately, living bit by bit of what I dreamed 2 years ago in 2021 and it\u2019s making me go insane cause everyday I wake up I have this weird feeling and \u201cknowing\u201d that I dreamed everything about this day(s) since I moved out of my lovely apartment, this feeling goes on for the rest of the day(s) It\u2019s kind of creepy and scary. The thing is I have no clue when I stopped dreaming these dreams 2 years ago. So I have no clue when these feelings and knowings will go away. I just want to live my life like it\u2019s a new day.. not like \u201cI dreamed all these days\u201d it\u2019s not new to me cause I dreamed it 2 years ago. \nWhat I dreamed for example, I dreamed about moving out to a new place, out of my apartment with my boyfriend, to a fourplex with a new roommate, this roommate was crazy in my dreams and got us evicted like 6 months later because I wouldn\u2019t break up with my boyfriend and date her, like she was crazy and lied to the landlord about all these alleged things I was doing like, smoking weed in the house when it was actually her and having a pet I shouldn\u2019t have when it was her lol I had no proof to say it was her shit, she got me evicted within 24hours because I was also APPARENTLY \u201cviolent\u201d and felt uncomfortable with me around and since she was a longtime (5 years) tenet to the landlord, ofc they had a bond and he believed her more then me a 6 month old tenant. I didn\u2019t want to fight it and take to court since it\u2019s a lot of work for nonsense shit, so Me and my bf just left. She did all that just because I wouldn\u2019t date her over my boyfriend I\u2019m committed to for over 2 years at the time\u2026\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened to me a year ago, when my brain started to realize I dreamed all this shit. In real life, she was indeed crazy, and got us evicted over all that same shit I dreamed of in 2021. I also dreamed about getting assaulted by my own towns police department. That happened in real life about a year ago. I also dreamed about falling and hitting my head and getting a pretty bad concussion. What\u2019s crazy tho after that happened, it triggered my brain to start remembering these dreams I had. Every single day since then when I hit my head, I\u2019ve been \u201creliving\u201d and remembering that I lived this before but in my dreams. \n(Before anyone says it\u2019s my concussion making me think this, it\u2019s not, when I had these dreams I would tell my boyfriend about all them when I woke up, I told him we shouldn\u2019t move out but we both just brushed it off as anxiety dreams but now it\u2019s happening and we\u2019re both pretty freaked out cause I predicted the future basically and we thought that was shit superficial stuff) \n\nI also dreamed about having to move back to my parents house for 2 months then moving out to an acreage with my boyfriend, we lived there for 2 weeks and then left because the guy that lived there was very creepy and really into me and harassed me a lot. He was older and I was younger, turned out he only accepted younger females in their 20\u2019s to live with him so he could have a sexual relationship with them aswell, I learned this from a previous tenant that lived there with him because I was suspicious and did some digging. Then I had to move back to my parents house for about 6 months, me and my boyfriend finally found a place, a main level suite on the north side of town and we didn\u2019t enjoy it but it was a place to live since it took so long to find a place to live at with each other. \n\nAll that actually happened in real life almost a year ago now on that acreage. Every single bit I dreamed of, it all happened in my dreams I dreamed about a year ago then. \nI am now living in that main suite with my boyfriend. We hate it but are getting used to it. But I\u2019m still waking up everyday remembering those dreams I had cause I\u2019m reliving them literally. I just want them to stop. Everyday I wake up remembering \u201cI\u2019ve lived this day in my dreams I had 2 years ago\u201d it\u2019s crazy and making me go crazy. I am still remembering bit my bit of those dreams, it feels like I\u2019ve lived this before because I dreamed of this future of mine and it\u2019s annoying and dreadful because I just want to live my days like there new like a brand new feeling of \u201cI don\u2019t know this day\u201d the feeling of new and not \u201cknew\u201d if you know what I mean lol. It\u2019s like deja vu but it\u2019s way to real feeling to be deja vu..\nSo\u2026 back to my question..\nIs it normal to dream of the future, like a whole year or 2 ahead of time and it actually happening? I\u2019m living those and I just want it to stop hahahaah. It\u2019s freaky and making me feel crazy. Has anyone ever had these type of dreams and are re lived them or currently re living them like I am? How do you cope?",

If we simply open the door to the primacy of ***Spiritual Health***, and work on that, the mental health will take care of itself. \n\n The essay explores the interconnectedness of spirituality and mental health, emphasizing that the latter is a subset of the former. It introduces the concept of a \"placeholder\" for Meaning and Belonging, a universal human yearning that transcends cultural and religious boundaries. The work argues that focusing solely on mental health is insufficient; a deeper sense of spiritual wellness is required for holistic well-being. It calls for a shift from seeking happiness and redemption to finding purpose and serving the world meaningfully, highlighting the vast potential within us. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfcg98gzeaxb1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=545f46b0e8db6c4d0df081e6499e01dcaa2f3860\n\n&#x200B;",

          "content": "Hello, I had an awakening experience some years ago and have been slowly working at releasing tension and trauma that has been stored in my body since then. One method I use for somatic release is to meditate on the pain/tension for some time, then to take a deep breath, hold and tense, then release the breath. Usually this causes a release of some kind, as my coping mechanism through life has been to unconsciously hold my breath when faced with overwhelming pain or emotion. \n\nHowever, lately I have been experiencing extreme headaches/pain behind my eyes when I have been doing this. The pain is excruciating but usually short lived, however recently I started to feel extreme panic during one of these releases, and it has made it (more) difficult to continue. I experienced extreme physical and emotional trauma as a child including accidental injury such as almost breaking my neck from a fall, sexual abuse, and physical and psychic/emotional attacks. \n\nI was wondering if anyone else has been on a similar path of healing and has been through these extreme somatic experiences, and can give me some reassurance that it is okay to continue and that I am not causing myself any further harm. Some of the sensations are incredibly unpleasant such as feeling like my head and neck are being wrenched apart in opposite directions, or my eyes are about to explode and my brain is being torn in half down the middle.\n\nThank you for your time, namaste",

We didn't have a good relationship, as she was controlling, manipulative and abusive all my life. We hadn't spoke the last year and a half of her life and I'm comfortable with that.

Now that I have that awareness, I'm struggling with how to let go.\n\nI know that mother wound needs to be healed, and I plan on ready She by Robert Johnson. I'm scared though. I'm scared that I'll relive so many hurtful moments in my life. Even though I know that it is a necessary process, I just don't want to go through it.\n\nSo, what advice do you have?

          "content": "I know this is going to sound crazy but just listen for a second. I swear every bit of what I'm going to explain is true and genuinely happened to me. Let me preface this by saying I was clean sober off of weed and haven't touched it in months prior due to health complications that caused me to stay at the hospital for some time so drugs can't be the explanation. To begin, the night started off as a normal night and I did my normal routines. Next I start to feel very anxious and scared for no reason and my dad decides to play meditative frequency songs to help but once it starts I grab my dads hand and squeeze hard enough to the point that my hand is shaking while staring directly into my dads pupils. Next I found myself falling infinitely into the reflection of his eyes (almost like in portal when you create a infinite portal and jump through it.) It felt like I was sucked into his eyes. It suddenly stopped and I was able to transport through peoples bodies through their eyes. It felt as if I was just my consciousness floating throughout the air. I was having fun jumping around until my mom and dad got me and pinned me down. The weird thing was that I felt as if they weren't my parents but they were a higher being channeling through my parents in order to stop me from losing control. Everything I tried to do to get away from their grip wasn't working. Each time I pushed they pushed back with an equal amount of force. Next thing I know I'm being dragged into the bathroom and thrown into the shower getting cold water poured on me. I could tell the water was cold but it didn't feel as if it were cold. It felt as if it were passing through me. Now I blackout but I can still hear my inner voice. And for some reason I was reminded of the bible and how it says how in the beginning there was nothing but darkness. I was inside that darkness. I was nothingness. It made me felt as free as I've ever felt but I also had a sense of suffering because it was almost like an infinite hell that you can't escape. It was like I was at the beginning of time waiting for the big bang to happen but it never came. It was just hopeless. Somehow I snap out of it and I'm the most terrified I've ever been and I'm being shipped off to my second stay at the hospital. \\[Does anybody have any insight on what might've happened to me?\\]\n\n[This is the best I can make of what I saw.

          "content": " Hello. I believe I might be experiencing what's known as a dark night of the soul. Three years ago, I was on top of the world, feeling invincible, happy, and most importantly, looking forward to my future with excitement. Since then, I've lost everything, primarily my career, which meant everything to me. My identity was truly built around my academic achievements; it was the one thing I excelled at, and losing it has completely shaken me and made me question all my life choices. I then lost all my friends, and my relationship with my family deteriorated. I'm living a real nightmare, and I can't understand how my life has taken such a turn. The worst part is that it's all my fault; I owe my failure to no one but myself. I made bad choices, relied on my past successes, and I'm paying the price. That's how I find myself, having failed professionally (although I'm still young and can rebuild), with almost no friends, having disappointed and brought shame to my family and those who believed in me.\n\nI'm going through a real existential crisis. I can't stop thinking about a whole host of existential questions about the meaning of life, who I really am; I'm beginning to question everything, and my entire life's framework is falling apart.\n\nI've always been drawn to spirituality, so I already knew what a dark night of the soul was, and it seems that's exactly what I'm experiencing today. Unless I'm just losing my mind, who knows.\n\nSo, I'm seeking advice from those who have gone through or are currently going through this dark night of the soul. What am I supposed to do? Should I try to get out of it at all costs, or should I, on the contrary, \"embrace the darkness\" and use this time to reflect on my life, my goals... I feel lost, it's extremely painful, but most importantly, I'm afraid. I'm moving forward in the dark, not knowing where to go. That's why your stories will be of tremendous help to me.\n\nThank you.",

Even if the situation happened only once, an unreleased and unresolved trauma can become trapped within the body and its energy field, causing tension, stress and possibly disease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a study proving this: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153850/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153850/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat alone robs us of our conscious awareness by making us take things way to seriously, become stuck in the past, ruled by our emotions and fear criticism.  If you don't already know our conscious awareness is one of our most powerful tool in this life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReleasing this stored, suppressed or blocked energy is a healthy, natural process that allows a person to resolve issues and to become more alive than before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne simple method to release this is by clearing them from your meridians (channels through which flows euphoric energy) (Chi, Prana,  Ecstasy, Vayus, Life force, Pit\u012b, Rapture and etc.).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing in full control of our conscious awareness opens us up to receive the infinite source of spiritual energy from the universe, yet these events robs us of our conscious awareness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat exactly is spiritual energy? On the energetic side you can observe this spiritual energy inside of you when you get goosebumps from watching inspiring movies, listening to moving or exciting music, feeling eager, thinking about someone you love and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration. Learning how to seperate that euphoria from our physical reaction of goosebumps is the key for that and to benefit from the many positive physical and spiritual usages that gaining control of this brings you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis energy has been documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) on how to clear your meridians to really tap into this energy or to allow yourself to feel it at a much higher intensity or longer duration,.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on r/spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",

As we were walking this guy blasting the song \u201cgangster paradise\u201d & my friend says, \n\u201cI noticed that this song has played 3 times whenever I\u2019m with you\u201d I\u2019ve never noticed that but hey! Super cool I guess.\n\nHours later I started talking about Miley Cyrus & how her older album was better, 10 mins later- an old heartbreak song from Miley Cyrus started playing from a shop. We both noticed & thought that was cool but freaky.\nSame thing happened after when we were talking about Michael Jackson & BAM a min later another guy on his bike blasting the \u201cthriller\u201d song!!!\n\nWe were getting kinda freaked out but amazed at the same time.\n\nThen we sit by the rocks to talk & we saw tiny crabs! I\u2019ve never seen one up close so I was having fun with watching them. An hour later he drops me off at my place. He comes back after picking his mom up from the airport & he goes \n\u201cDude guess what my mom got me\u2026\u201d\n\nIt was a magnet crab.\n\nWe tried doing some research on this that same night because we know there\u2019s a meaning to it but we have NO IDEA how to look it up properly!!! Everything is all connected to what we were mentioning but what does it mean??",

I cannot read Arabic but this woman has wings and she is dripping with a black liquid from her mouth and it is surrounding her wings as she dies. I can only see part of her face but her body is of perfection. Her wings are as white as the beautiful summer clouds and as full as can be she has a golden crown on her head. The crown is beautiful it looks like woven plants. What does this mean? Is there a story behind it is there? A deeper meaning is it a symbol of hope or of dispair.",

Reason being I am currently on medication for my mental health and sleep issues and that kinda took over my practice a bit. I've got back into it about 1-2 months ago and sometimes I have really great meditations and tarot readings but like nothing after that? Idk what to do I feel really lost. Like I feel the connection to my spirit guides and ancestor strong enough to know they are there but when i ask for guidance I am not getting anything? I'm not sure if my intution is weak or if I am unable to get their signs. Also I've noticed over the past 2 weeks I've been coming across a bunch of angle numbers almost every day.\n\nWhat do you do in such a situation? Could someone reccomend any practice or meditation or anything that could help me? I feel stuck in my spiritual journey and I wanna step ahead and do more. I feel ready!  \nAlso thank you so much for reading all this. I hope you have a nice day! :)",

However, ever since moving to the US I have been self reliable and pretty much providing for my siblings to some degree. I met an enlightened man a while ago and the soulful and unconditional love and depth I received...I can't put it into words. Of course physical attraction was there but this person wanted to know me and all I was. Before then, all I had knows was 'duty', 'family expectations', 'societal pressures', now my path crossed with this person I can't look at love the same ever again. \n\nMy parents marriage was toxic and my dad had a HUGE ego. So I never could model what real nurturing love and care was except how my mom showed us. \n\nUnfortunately the relationship did not last because I had several toxic traits that surfaced and was codependent and anxious/avoidant... I'm healing and reading aton of self help books and the issue is I'm torn on if I want to marry simply because I'm in my 20s. There's a lot more inner work I want to do- ...yoga, spiritual retreats, conscious touch and movement therapy and LOTS of self-love... and I yearn for that kind of love again but I don't feel I can find it by being pressured or as easily...The world is overpopulated. I feel alot of marrige happens during the honeymoon stage and thats what breeds resentment and potential divorce. \n\nIm young and a little naiive (only really had flings and hookups before meeting this divine man) are there any tips for people who would rather wait or encouragement to heal before finding a solid partner and not just husband ? If you're raised abroad in a more conservative country and have similar feelings id love to hear your views too.\n\nThanks \ud83c\udf38",

Any insight would be amazing!\nMy first dream I was walking along side of a woman I didn't recognize, she kept telling me I can open the door to the dead. She said a few times. It was weird cause I remember opening an oven door and it was just dark with things floating around.\nThe next dream I was running alongside a man I didn't recognize away from multiple people who were trying to hurt me. We got into a car and I asked the man why these people or beings are after me and he said it's because you are more powerful then them. The feeling though that I got in my dream was a good feeling, like I finally know why certain things happen. Idk. I know they are weird but they are the only 2 dreams I have had with people talking directly to me and guiding me throughout my dream. Maybe they were spirit guides?? Idk, all of this is new to me still so any input is much appreciated! \n\nThank you \ud83d\udc9c",

We as humans need interconnectedness and that\u2019s goal of a spiritual awakening is to reach oneness within yourself and the universe. If you\u2019re still uncomfortable with vulnerability whether it\u2019s emotional or physical, you should ask yourself if you\u2019re actually awakened because you become an open light source that embraces love, trauma, heartache, celebration. You can *feel* it all and most people choose not to feel. But feelings, having expectations, and being sensitive, is not a weakness, it\u2019s something you should uphold to and desire.",

          "content": "Hello! \n\nI\u2019ve been struggling to sleep for quite some time, so last night I decided to put on a sleep meditation track to help me drift off. The track itself included a full body scan to easy parts of the body as I tried to drift into sleep. \n\nAs I was trying to focus on parts of the body, my mind began to wander - I am by no means an expert meditator, very much a novice so this isn\u2019t unusual for me. However something happened and I\u2019m really not sure what it was or what happened. \n\nIn short, as I was trying to sleep I felt quite awake and even though my eyes closed I felt as though as was blinking. Not in the sense of I felt the muscles in and around my eyes were blinking, but more of the idea that I physically felt the darkness of blinking overlapping the darkness of having my eyes closed. This happened a few times last night, but is something I\u2019ve experienced before. \n\nWhilst I don\u2019t have an explanation and never have been able to find out what it is, it didn\u2019t bother me as much as the other things. In between 2 of the blinks, I had quite a bright flash of light and saw two different faces very far away from me, almost as if I was viewing them through reel viewer. I don\u2019t know who these people were, they seemed distorted but I felt a comfort within them. As they appeared I felt my body go limp, and after the second face appeared I forced myself to move and open my eyes - as I was quite worried about what I had experienced, mostly because I didn\u2019t know what it was. \n\nHas anyone had something similar, or is aware of anything that sounds like this? Part of me hopes it is something deeper, but I\u2019m also skeptical of myself as I was trying to sleep\n\nAny help is appreciated!",

Where I could float with the stars, jet around the universe all while being serenaded by the chimes and deep hum of space. It was pure ecstasy. I can\u2019t even really explain what was happening to me. I felt like I had been seen by the universe, that I had been allowed to see beyond our existence and peer into the beautiful unknown.\n\nTo this day I\u2019m still inspired by that time, I\u2019m still a believer in that world inside my head, that when my time comes I will end up there for eternity.\n\nI have never done drugs or anything but this experience can only be likened to what I\u2019ve heard from intense mushroom trips. I have no idea what happened to me or why this triggered. I always put it down to the fact that I was near breaking point and my brain just flooded my system with some kinda of ecstasy.\n\nThe song that kicked it all off, and what I ended up naming that world after, was \u2018Void\u2019 by \u2018The Neighbourhood\u2019\n\nHas anyone any idea what I experienced and what this could all mean?",

Lately due to some impending family deaths and separations I'm in the process of 'letting go' of every last part of my entire life, and it feels as if I'm free falling in a bottomless hole. Since I've been through a few 'deaths' since joining AA I'm familiar with the feeling but it's feeling a lot more \"all-encompassing\" now that I don't have a conceptual identity left except perhaps my work.\n\nI can accept the feeling when I'm at home but it's painful and hard to try to escape, but since I'm clean and can't escape with drugs or alcohol I can only escape using distractions and gritting my teeth.\n\nBut I get more and more tendencies to re-attach to old parts of my life, or to search for romantic relationship or dysfunctional relationships just to escape through drama or infatuation. It's almost as an automatic defense mechanism triggering when I'm not completely aware in a social situation and then it causes me even more pain when I'm alone since I have to keep myself from stimulating the drama by messages etc.\n\nHow can I learn to stay in this transformation without backpedalling, is it prayer and meditation that holds the key or just pure patience?",

Was fit and healthy and my new coaching business was starting to provide me with a full salary. I thought I\u2019d healed from my past trauma for the most part. I had brilliant health care and a mental health team to fall to in times of crisis. After years of travelling the world, I was super content living a simple, balanced healthy life.\n\nThen covid came alone, at the same time as my 3 good friends moving out of the city. I was alone. I lost all my clients due to budget cuts. My family back in the U.K. weren\u2019t calling, my friends back there were over run with parental duties so had no time to talk. I was approaching 40 and terrified I would not fulfil my dream of having a loving family. It was making me crazy. I started dating a guy and it was going we well until he heard about my past (dysfunctional family, not speaking to my father, etc) and literally dumped me on the spot. It didn\u2019t align with his super close family experience. Covid was slowly breaking me and after being dumped I had a breakdown and was suicidal. I had the blue lights outside the door about to break it down because someone had alerted them to my concerning behaviour. I was released from hospital the next day. That\u2019s where it all started to unravel. My mental health remained rock bottom for months and my friends back home were pushing that I sell up and move back home. I did that.\n\nFor the past 2.5 years I have spent much of the money from the house. Desperate attempts to resurrect my business have failed (you can\u2019t coach when unwell nor market yourself), my friends have barely made time to see me. My family are more closed off than ever due to several deaths in the family. I\u2019ve tried to get a job in a different field but no success competing with people with experience. I now cannot afford to rent and can\u2019t even get a rental in a cheap place because I have no salary and biz accounts minimal and nobody will be my guarantor. So Ive been living in a van for the past 8 months. At first it felt empowering but now I feel like a homeless person.\n\nSo where I am today is stuck. Backed up in the corner believing it is inevitable that I will end my life. Not this week but maybe in a month or 2, or 6 months. My brain is preparing it all and psyching up. I DO NOT want this to be the story. And at the same time I don\u2019t see any other way. My family don\u2019t get me, I will not have my own family, im undateable atm, lost my flat, blown most of my money, can\u2019t run my business or get a job, remaining friends not able to support. It feels like I\u2019ve already died because I\u2019m at such a distance from the world.\n\nPart of my brain is trying to help me to survive this. Searching for solutions and actions to take. Trying to create a new vision for the future but I don\u2019t see one. I feel like my only hope is my spirituality and seeking a different perspective for all this.\n\nCan anyone help with this?",

Just lost on the journey.\n\nThis spiritual journey is a lonely one, I think I'm at the point where I'm hitting a bit of a wall, I'm about a year in to a spiritual awareness/ awakening hitting me and I'm finding it very isolating and difficult at this moment. Feels each day it's getting worse and trying to find a way to stop it asap. \n\nThere may be multiple reasons for this and especially around this time of year as 8 years ago I lost my grandpa early in the month and lost my grandma 2 years ago on Halloween night. Throw in multiple birthdays through the month and Halloween events, and heading into the winter months. October is always very overwhelming for me. The past 4 years I've gotten intense depression like clockwork every October.\n\nI was doing well up until the last 5 days or so and it's hit me like a ton of bricks again, the amount of people in my life who understand or can relate is absolutely zero. ( they try but don't really understand) I'm still not even sure what is happening really on some days as well. Most days, I'm very strong mentally and very sure on things and some days it's the exact opposite and just constant noise in my head that's just pure distraction. The stress from working constantly full time and having no time for anything else is also crushing me at the moment. \n\nI am truly grateful for what I have at the moment but at the same time it's exactly opposite of what i truly want and what my inner soul is telling me I need over the past 6-12 months. Circumstances out of my control as health issues of others/ insane rent costs just to get a one bedroom tin can apartment are impede my moving forward with my partner. Health issues/ work doesn't allow us to see each other more than once a week most weeks, and it's been like this for many years were it's just being stuck in the same cycle and that dream is always just out of reach because of expenses( getting worse) and family members health issues.\n\nExample is that was supposed to see each other tonight and had to cancel because covid is floating around my workplace, so can't risk getting their family member sick. It's really disheartening when it's the only thing I'm looking forward too and then it falls through.( Not going to put them in potentially endangering their loved one, but just a shitty situation).\n\nLive in a city small apartment barley scraping by and when nature is my true home and is calling me to it. I do realize this sounds like complaining when I realize so many others have so little and have been through souch worse and that I'm lucky to not be so much worse off. \n\nI guess I'm just lacking connection on a deeper level and don't really know where to turn next on this path. So this is me reaching out to the universe, on one of the most amazing pieces of technology and the most amazing communication tool we have in the interwebs. \nIt's truly remarkable source of communication and information. \n\nBeen doing the work to clear out my traumas and get rid of substance absue issues that I was using for covering up those trauma's from my teen years. Definitely not going to stop or quit as this is the way forward but just reaching out.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas, groups, links, or information or really anything you could suggest to help me on my journey and struggles at this current time. It would be very much appreciated from this wandering soul looking for a sign. \n\nThanks for reading this long post as well!! :) \nCan be therapeutic writing it all out and putting it out there!",

Mind you, it was dark, but i still saw my door, walls, bed, everything  vibrating. I said to myself, calmly: \"I've awaken, I can now see\" and then proceeded to go to bed.\nI woke up feeling a combination of peace, resignation and also a sense of understanding of myself I haven't felt before. \nAnyone has experienced something alike?",

I felt very understood and seen when I was speaking to them and I can\u2019t even explain the feeling but I felt very safe and comfortable. We were very very similar In both good and bad ways anyway I feel as though he was my karma and I felt like he made me very aware of my avoidant attachment issues which in this case actually turned into anxious (bc like I said we were very similar). \n\nAnyways after this experience I feel as though I want to learn how to open my heart up to receiving and giving love. I can finally admit to itself that I want to be able to have a connection with someone else that\u2019s as deep as the one I have with myself. However, I have extreme issues with being vulnerable and I have the tendency to count things out for myself before even trying. My mom raised me with a very very hyper-independent mindset and instilled values within me such as don\u2019t rely on anybody, learn how to do everything yourself, no point in showing  your emotions, don\u2019t cry about things etc etc. however the issue for me is I feel like I\u2019ve been cursed with an annoying amount of emotional awareness ( which I can admit is hyper vigilance masking as self improvement. it's really fear of failure) so I\u2019m aware of all these issues but I\u2019m not sure how to actually stop them. \n\nI have a million more questions and no one to talk about spiritual topics with, I want to add that I do believe in God but not in a rigid sense. If anyone could recommend me any books or even message me with any advice about this subject or any others that you think could help me on this journey I\u2019d appreciate it so so much. Thank you \ud83e\ude77\n\n(Please only message me with good intentions I really can not handle any hidden meanings or things such as that that may cause me to become emotionally attached and then upset) \ud83d\ude02",

          "content": "my spiritual cleanse includes sharing this w the community, you fellow spiritual enlightment and truth seekers as witnesses.\n\nThe astrologer - connected to my mother - has explained once more what he thinks about my birth chart.  \nI\u2019m writing this down, bc deep down I know, there is a lot of junk of what he said. He used to instill deep seated doubts and crippling, paralyzing insecurity, also bc he predicted \u2013 not mine thank God, and I\u2019m praying for continual protection \u2013 accidents and sicknesses of others, just everything related to negative, accurately to a day (plus minus three) via progressive chart.  \nI started to do some spiritual cleansing, through journaling I\u2019ve come to the conclusion, how much toxic and subtle emotional abuse and manipulation has been going on.\n\nAs part of my healing process I share w you what he says.  \n(I am not a newbie in astrology, bc of the astrologer\u2019s traumatizing words, haunted me for years I have researched a lot. I had the inclination, even tho I knew deep down, there was something wrong w what that person say, I allowed the person\u2019s words to claim power over in my life. I am a very spiritually sensitive, so I know what words can cause IF you give them power. especially by ppl like this astrologer \u2013 he claims to be always right, then continues to tell you about all the negative things he has predicted right in other ppl\u2019s life.)\n\nThe reason I share his interpretation here, bc I believe it is part of my (healing) journey. I am doing this and simultaneously I am reclaiming my REAL identity. The person, the higher power who created me, made me to be. by posting his - imho- junk interpretation I am declaring to the spiritual and the material world that i am spiritually cutting off ALL bonds, and chains he has put upon me. I am reclaiming my power over my life -and breaking whatever power he might have over me- w the higher power having the ultimate power over my life.  \nby doing that, i am also raising more and more awareness at whenever I need to set boundaries and put up a shield when that astrologer is trying to (re)claim power - he often just \"means it well and wants to help\".\n\nIf you have any divine-inspired thoughts you want to share, I thank you in advance.  \nActually I have written my own interpretation of my birth chart - mainly focusing on my Venus-Moon opposition and the nodes \u2013 [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advancedastrology/comments/17373ch/my_interpretation_of_12h_6h_polarity_venussn_12h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (in case you might want to read it as well)\n\nmy birth chart is [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/12thhouse/comments/167fn14/the_hard_to_put_in_words_longing_for_ethereal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nHis - imho mainly wrong - interpretation:  \nYears ago, he told me I\u2019m not going to have intercourse very often. However I will be able to experience pleasure \u2013 more intense \u2013 than average ppl. However, this will happen very, very, very rarely. These pleasurable experiences will be intense, but very short lived and I will be very alone. there will be dry periods for a very very long time in between.\n\nHe recently explained why: his reason for the aforementioned, is bc of my tight Capricorn Saturn-Neptune conjunction in the 5H. Acc to him, the 5H is the house of pleasure, and bc Saturn is domicile and ruler here, there is no fun. His words about Neptune: Neptune is nothingness. Saturn wants to restrict, w Neptune-nothingness here, what\u2019s there to restrict.\n\n(I tried w him, over several years discussing w him. Until I realized recently, he is one of these guys \u2013 yes, his predictions of all things related to sickness and stuff of other ppl was accurate \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like it when you challenge him. When our argument gets heated \u2013 for example I said Venus in Pisces is exalted, why do you say so much negative about my Leo Venus 12H - and there is nothing he can say: he says \u201cYou\u2019re talking so much junk right now, it\u2019s unbearable. And then proceeds on telling me, how right he was about others, he is never wrong \u2013 which of course made me so crippingly insecure in the past. Bc how could a astrologer who could predict sicknesses, accidents and even worse precise to three days, be wrong? See the subtle abuse, I was putting myself up w?)\n\nyears he said something like, I\u2019m not going to have a relationship, a usual one that is. Bc my descendant is in Pisces and since my 7H is empty and pisces means d\\*ath (back then I was like? What? But his \u201cother accurate predictions\u201d instilled a deep seated crippling fear)\n\nthen he said: I live my 7H through my 12H. since my Leo Venus 12H is there. The Venus is \u201cafflicted\u201d, bc 12H is the house of undoing. The Venus is dissolving itself, disintegrating. A natural desire of Venus is to be w someone, but here \u2026 afflicted. bc how can a dissolving Venus be, do Venusian?\n\nWhen I mentioned the lunar nodes, he once said to ignore the annoying nodes, then said he meant it in a way that I just saw my nodes in relation to my planets and nothing more.",

The universe is being very persistent with me. So I am looking for individuals willing to shed some light on their experience. \n\nWhat worked for you? What references did you resonate with when exploring the depths of your soul? What was crucial for your development? And what was one thing you wish you did differently / had been prepared for prior? \n\nThe last time I did inner child healing was about two years ago. I had done a soul retrieval with a shaman, some work with any other, as well as some self work on my own using the book Greater than the sum of our parts by Richard Schwartz. I really enjoyed that method but I struggled early on with connecting to my inner child vs. my conscious mind taking the wheel. I\u2019m more aligned with my intuition these days.\n\nI know a lot of people have shared working in tandem with a psychologist/ counselor. I have had a really hard time finding the right fit and after paying out of pocket for 2 that we\u2019re not experienced in the level of work I wanted to do.

You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.  \n\n\nLearning how to extract that euphoria from our physical reaction is the key for that and to benefit from the many positive physical and spiritual usages that gaining control of this brings you.  \n\n\nThis energy has been documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.  \n\n\nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) going more in-depth on how to control your energy and to understand where it comes from.  \n\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on r/spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it. ",

          "content": "over five years ago, I took a trip to California when I was 15 for Thanksgiving. I Have an amazing awesome uncle who I love he stopped at a MEDMAN dispo and got us a Joint. We stayed for four days during this trip and the second day we decided to smoke a joint, around evening maybe 630 me and my sister went outside on the porch and the smoked whole thing. I remember taking the last few hits off the roach, putting it back inside the dube tube and walking back inside to my bedroom. This is where the experience began. The high felt normal as I smoked million times before but I remember laying back onto the bed and seeing geometric objects forming in front of me I was a bit taken aback, but having experienced LSD and mushrooms I wasn\u2019t too shaken as I laid on the bed, staring at these objects. the ceiling fan above, begin to put me into a trance, I remember becoming hyper fixated an the wall sort of melting. I remember looking down at my body to see this greenish brownish aura arising, and I could feel a pull as if I was going with it, and at that moment, I remember feeling myself rise from my body into the room and then turn in the air to look back at myself, lying in the bed. At the time we were going to dinner with the family so I felt this urge this feeling, as if I couldn\u2019t leave as if I couldn\u2019t go, but this Pull or cosmic feeling was telling me that I needed to learn, but when I resisted and told it I couldn\u2019t leave, and I couldn\u2019t learn. It abruptly told me I wasn\u2019t ready and forced me back into my body. I remember jolting out of bed taking a huge breath of air, my eyes wide, completely dilated pupils my ears were ringing so loudly I was trying to act normal as if nothing happened and unable to hear anything they\u2019re saying things to me with this ringing taking up my entire conscience. I know something just happened I could feel it. There was something different about that experience. There was something that told me that I needed to learn but I wasn\u2019t ready. What do I do ?? I\u2019ve tried meditation and DMT another psychedelics, but I\u2019ve never experienced something like that. And I\u2019m unable to replicate it. I would like to either understand what happened or opinions. Sorry for so long and any spelling errors.",

          "content": "\nBy Alessandro Carosi\n\n\nI was in Brighton this weekend and first thing coming out from the train station was obviously drinking a coffee, I wanted the first from a coffee shop that I remember from my last visit called Pelicano but on my way an other one caught my attention \u2026. called Ikigai, I thought to be Japanese and the minimalistic design in wood that\u2019s my style so I had to try it.\n\nI get inside order a filter and chit chatting find out that the owner wasn\u2019t Japanese but from Hong Kong, the cafe\u2019 design and name deceived me but never mind cause the reason to chose it was my interest for Japan and that I\u2019m studying Japanese but coffee especially coffee doesn\u2019t have nationalities and borders at least in my own world.\n\nThe guy didn\u2019t disappoint me delivering one of the nicest filters I had for a long time and kindly enough he brewed an other one from a Hong Kong roastery that was just wonderful, felt like I was drinking a lemon grass tea, he knows his job and you could tell the passion as well.\n\nI\u2019m not writing about coffee here even if look like and obviously coffee is one of my life calls and purpose, the reason behind this article is what happend toward the end \u2026.. I tell him I would follow on Instagram and drop a message so that he knows is me, before leaving I say that my IG account name is Nomad barista that will be who send the msg and hearing that he tells me that a friend talked about me before, I was like \u2026\u2026. What?? Are you sure??? I thought to be a mistake but when he tells me that his friend from Taiwan living in Guilford been in London and met me I remebered who was it, we met in a cafe\u2019 in Chelsea and had a great chat about coffee and then met again in Islington where we tried some coffee she brought from Taiwan.\n\nCan you see the connection? The dots getting togheter at some point? The energy that connects all of us? The invisible thread?\n\nI live in London and in Brighton for a couple of days having a coffee in a cafe\u2019 thinking to be from Japan but owned by a guy from Hong Kong, we talk about coffee and we end up knowing the same person that lives in Guilford an other town not too far from Brighton and London, look at the wonderful spider net of connections and synchronicities, can you still call it coincidence even things like this happened thousands of times?\n\nWe are united by a force that we can\u2019t see but exist and we been told that our lives is our work and all is based on money and stock markets and an endless buying and selling materialistic items of which most of it of no value, can you see that what we been told till now is a lie? There is more much more than what we can see, smell and hear.\n\nWake up folks, wake up to your own immense power, begin to discover your inner self and learning that a different way to live is possible.",

I guess it's not numb maybe it's just nothing has been going well and I kinda became that person and life has become that way also. It's almost like careless despite you're being aware of it. For example, if you fail at something and repeatedly keep failing. You just sorta get in the habit of failing and eventually become careless like oh well, I failed in the past and current might as well fail in future. And it's really worrying me like when am I going to become fully conscious about this situation.",

          "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nIm new to the community, I was just coming on here to somewhat seek for reassurance haha! For a quick backstory im diagnosed with OCD and have struggled immensely with anxiety the majority of my life. This past year was a very hard year for me, my OCD symptoms really surfaced to its full potential. I went through a breakup after being with my SO for 5 years due to these symptoms, the first 3-4 months after the breakup was hard but a literal switch flicked overnight in like June, I had no more anxiety, OCD symptoms, sadness, stress, I was at overall peace within myself. I felt like I was on top of the world for the first little bit because this sensation of Being was within me. After that point I started craving natures presence, I was hiking a lot, opening a lot of time outdoors. Although I work full time I was felt myself craving this feeling of being outside and just exploring the world. Like it was such a strange feeling, it was taking over me. It was an amazing month and I spent a lot of time outside and was fully at peace. I had a slight hiccup in my life last week and I spent a lot of time down in the dumps, I was experiencing a lot of sadness but I welcomed the emotions I was experiencing. I kept questioning whether or not what I've been striving for is real or not. What initially reignited my willingness to explore and be one with nature was unfortantely a tiktok video I came across, it really inspired me to start doing what I love again. Due to my crazy OCD mind, I've been having these continuous the intrusive thoughts that keep circulating in my brain which are: \"do you even enjoy doing this?\" \"is this even you?\" \"am I forcing a spiritual awakening or do I genuinely feel this presence?\" \n\nIts hard for me to navigate through these intrusive thoughts because I am so passionate about becoming more mindful, spiritually in touch with myself, being one with nature, and just being overall enlightened in my life. After my hard week last week I made a plan for myself, its not forced, this all came from trial and error through my depressive week. Every morning I started off by listening to a podcast that ia relevant to however im feeling in that moment and I write out a lengthy entry in my journal. It usually starts off negative but leads to a more positive affirming entry. I then listen to a guided meditation depending on how im feeling that day. For example, this morning I woke up and I was a little bit stressed, mostly because of these scary intrusive thoughts I've been having; I just don't want to be portraying a fake image of myself through delusion. im start enough to know that this is not delusion and that this is genuinely how I feel in my life right now but my OCD will usually have the upper hand in these kinds of situations and say \"ya but what if you're wrong?\" These are the first intrusive thoughts I've had since I started this spiritual journey.\n\nAnyways, this is turning into a brainless emotion dump but I would really like to hear some insight. its hard for me to put everything into words because this is just a feeling, its hard to write it down. I hope this reaches the right people:)",

Now, as an adult my beliefs have changed in many ways. First off let me clarify, I was never a Bible thumping Christian with strong  and unshakable faith. As I've aged and have studied and debated and shared my own thoughts and listened to others I feel more spiritual. I believe in bits and pieces from multiple different religions. For example,  I believe in reincarnation. I believe that Hell on Earth is not a simple saying. I think we are put on earth to suffer and to find ourselves and how to be...a good person? One with the universe? Enlightened? I'm not sure...but, if you're a shit person..guess what.....youll be someone'sThanksgiving turkey in your next life. That homeless person you threw your garbage at? They'll be an owl and you'll be the rat in your next lives. I also don't think there is a one, singular God. Honestly if there is, I think he/she got bored and walked away from us a loooong time ago. If God is real.....I'm not going to worship a person that attempts to teach love, but hates so hard. Or a person (or entity/God/whatever) that is all knowing...so they know i dont believeand i will sin and i will go to hell?.....ok then....why bother? I feel like I bounce around a lot, and am exploring and learning more and more everyday....i really like the person im becoming and think my journey is interesting and may be interesting to others as well...I'd love to hear about what you believe too.",

Like last night I woke up and was convinced there was smoke in the room and eventually realized there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen such a huge variety of things and most of what I\u2019ve seen lately is hard to describe. I try to reach out and touch it and it takes me a while to ground back to this reality.\n\nThis has happened a lot in the past too, before I had a spiritual awakening. At first they were full on night terrors where I\u2019d wake up screaming and jump out of bed. But eventually I learned how to ground myself and not panic. When it got really persistently bad my doctor put me on antipsychotics and it stopped so I stopped the pills after a couple months. Then it would only come back briefly.\n\nBut it\u2019s been very consistent again. I thought it was lack of sleep but I started getting more sleep and it got worse and I started seeing some stuff during the day. My acupuncturist told me it could be beings from the other side of the veil trying to communicate and to set boundaries repeatedly. After the daytime stopped and nighttime stopped for a couple days. But the nighttime is back and won\u2019t seem to go away no matter what boundaries I try to set.\n\nSo now I am not sure what to think is happening. Anyone out there reading this who is familiar with this kind of thing and knows how to tell the difference between some spiritual weirdness happening or some non-spiritual mental issue that just needs drugs? I don\u2019t want to medicate again if this is just another spiritual awakening type thing that I need to learn how to deal with better, but if it\u2019s not that then maybe I do need to try meds again.\n\nNot sure so thought I\u2019d see if anyone out there has experience with this because there\u2019s not exactly a lot of spiritually awakened Western medical doctors out there that I can consult \ud83d\ude10",

I just wanted to know what do others believe in, without the mention of religion as I\u2019m not religious\n\nMy pov is that you become a lost soul and get \u201cstuck\u201d in this dimension, forever. \n\nI may have suicidal ideations but I feel like the answers to this question will help, I guess.\n\n(I stopped anti depressants recently and I\u2019m trying to replace them with ashwagandha, meditation & yoga, but these suicidal ideations can become bothersome) \n\nTIA <3",

However, the workers noticed something peculiar about him. \n\nWhile Oscar usually preferred to be alone, he occasionally crawled into a resident's bed and snuggled beside them. \n\nThe eerie thing about this is that the resident that Oscar would cuddle with would usually die within hours.\n\nInitially, the staff didn't think much of it, but after this happened 20 times, they started to believe that Oscar knew when someone was close to passing away, and so when they noticed the cat next to a resident, they would call their loved ones to warn them. \n\nResearchers speculate that Oscar could smell biochemicals released by dying cells and so chose to comfort lonely residents.\n\nOn one occasion, the staff was convinced that a resident was about to pass away, but Oscar refused to sit with them. Instead, he chose another resident who looked healthier, and that person passed away first.\n\nOscar died in 2022, and over the course of his life he accurately predicted over 100 deaths.\u201d\n\nway to go oscar \ud83d\udd49\ufe0f\ud83e\udeb7\ud83c\udf3f",

The first are glowing/transparent orbs that are made of energy specifically related to an energy/emotion/vibration/frequency that is either being sent out from you or drawn to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second type that you can also come in contact with are made of non-physical being/spirit or being used as a vehicle for a consciousness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese Orbs can and have been spotted in photos/videos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what I researched and learned after having experienced multiple contacts with them. Most of those contacts happened while I was circulating my spiritual energy. I'd even go as far as to say that ever since I started circulating this spiritual energy is when I started noticing them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA simple definition for spiritual energy is that blissful wave that can most easily be felt/recognized as present while you get goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring one of my meditation sessions, As I was sweeping my whole body up then down with this energy while feeling intense gratitude, I saw from my half closed eyes, a golden orb the size of a grapefruit approach me and enter my body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was one of the first times I experienced those orbs in 2013. I still do to this day and I know this was successful thanks to the circulation of that blissful wave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis energy has been researched and documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearning how to do this is really simple.\n\nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) that will introduce you to this energy, help you feel it on command, witness these orbs and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on [r/spiritualchills](http://r/spiritualchills) where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",

(Sorry I\u2019m still getting my terms right\u2026) has been triggering fear and panic in me resulting in a sort of amplified anxiety. I would have sudden palpitations and instantly my brain would think of all the ways this could go south and make things worse. I\u2019ve been isolating a lot, wfh for a while. I gotta get back next week. Videos from Christina Lopes have been truly helpful. But despite knowing that I\u2019m experiencing everything she described and that there\u2019s \u201cno reason\u201d to be afraid\u2026 I cannot get rid of this fear/strange panic. I\u2019m also on the autism spectrum so some emotions are naturally amplified for me making things more challenging.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? How long did it take for you to go back to normal? And do you have any advice please?",

          "content": "good morning \ud83c\udf18 today is a big day in many regards\n\n* friyay is the end of a typical work week \n* friyay the 13th is the first day the Knights Templar were rounded up and jailed, only to have some burned at the stake after serving the church for hundreds of years \n* today specifically, in these particularly dark days on earth, there are some who are calling for militant attacks on innocent in the \u2018name of THEIR god\u2019 today \n\nalways perplexes me when I hear supposed religious, faithful or devout people yak about their loving god .. and then those very people are the first ones to take up arms for their loving god against another who has a different loving god \ud83e\udd7a how and why do humans constantly get god so wrong \ud83d\ude14\n\nNO god calls for nor approves of death in their name, especially christ \n\nthat said: I am choosing today to share with you someone elses words about christ, which I read a few months ago and found quite intriguing \ud83e\udd14 for you know my opinion on the church, the bible, modern day christianity and the damn vatican: none have anything whatsoever to do with christ \ud83d\udc9c\n\nso read this and please share your thoughts with me \ud83d\ude4f\n\n\n\u201cJesus didn't teach ascension\"\n\nOf course he did. It's one of his primary teachings. Jesus is as New Age as it gets. He literally promised a New Heaven and a New Earth.\n\nThe problem is that modern Christians are following Church doctrine, not Jesus's teachings. They repeat 1 or 2 verses which are inaccurate representations of what he said.\n\n\"There is no way to the father but through me\"\n\nFirst of all, what does this have to do with being murdered for God? Nothing. So why do modern Christians disregard his teachings in favor of a pagan blood sacrifice?\n\nJesus spoke Aramaic. No one tries to research what he really said because it reverses much of what the Church taught.\n\nHe said ABWOON (Source) not ABBA (Father). His entire message was about God being within us. There is no way to Source but to go within. His message is the only way, not worship of angry gods ordering murder and slavery (anunnaki). Not once did Jesus refer to Yahweh-Jehovah as God.\n\nJesus didn't say he would return to rule this world as a king, he said he'd take us where he is. A place where \"many mansions\" are prepared (5D Earth). \n\nWhat will happen? \"In a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be  changed; one will be taken and one will be left behind.\" (People will vanish)\n\nHow will we know it's coming? \"At that time they will see the Son of Man (like humans) coming in a cloud with power and great glory (UFOs).\u00a0When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.\u201d\n\nJesus didn't practice blood rituals to God so he couldn't have been a final sacrifice to his own God. He never mentioned Yahweh or Jehovah at all. He didn't claim he was going to die for our sins. In the story, he didn't volunteer, he was betrayed.\n\nHe taught that God was within and we will do even greater miracles. Modern Christians mindlessly repeats slogans like \"Jesus is King\", and are clear they believe more in the power of demons than angels.\n\nJesus didn't create religion. He didn't travel around telling people he was God. He said the kingdom of God is within us, that we are gods too, and we will do greater miracles than he did.\n\nChurch doctrine is brainwashing to keep you away from what Jesus taught.\u201d\n\nI M H O: this is 100000% on point \u2728 tell me your thought and please .. be safe today\n\nbe humble, small, sober and vigilant .. for the forces of evil are closer than ever \ud83e\udeb7",

Occasionally they are kissing. Other times I only see the female silhouette looking around as if she's looking for the male silhouette. Now this started after meeting my ex. We were absolutely perfect together and loved each other. It felt like our souls were meant to be together. We'd lay down and stare into each others eyes and it just felt so right. He broke it off to go to Europe as he had been planning to go there and find himself and figure out what he wants in life. i don't blame him. He told me I was probably the love of his life and he'd have nightmares about our break up for the rest of his life. I'm not sure if he ever plans on coming back. I feel horrible as I told him I would hate him if he left. But it's been four months and I still love him so goddamn much that it kills me inside. The idea of being with someone else makes me dizzy and want to throw up. I love him and he was my favorite person. My dreams are filled with us reuniting and it hurts to wake up. I've been getting into meditation and trying to connect with a higher power because I'm so tired of missing him and want to feel complete by myself. Nothing works though. Every manifestation has appeared in my life except him. I manifested a promotion and I got it. I manifested my dad getting a job and he got it the next day. I manifest money and it comes. Sometimes I can almost feel him holding me at night like he's actually there but it fades when I pull myself out of the fantasy. I'm conflicted in staying in my fantasy and memories of him. Sometimes I try not to but he always pops up in my head, even to simple things like someone saying something he used to say. The pain of his absence is no longer unbearably but l'm still always missing him hoping for his return. What do these visions mean? Why can't I get him out of my head? How am I supposed to let go when even the hug of another reminds me of him.",

The feelings of betrayal hurt more than the physical scars sometimes. \n\nI feel like being raped by a stranger took away my trust in others and the world around me. It was the first time in my life I knew for certain that evil exists and truly horrifying shit happens in our world that we can\u2019t control. \n\nAfter someone I considered a friend raped me it felt like an even bigger betrayal. I could handle the betrayal of a stranger, but now even friends aren\u2019t safe!? I trusted them and our friendship and they took advantage of my trust. It sucked and a part of me felt heartbroken because of their betrayal. \n\nA man I dated on and off for 4 years verbally and sexually abused me. He raped me too many times to count or remember them all. I loved him and he claimed he loved me. I was young and lacking self-confidence. Growing up no one ever taught me how to love myself or my body. All I was shown was how to criticize and condemn my body for not being skinny enough, flawless enough, perfect enough\u2026 He was the first person in my life who showed me how to love my body exactly as it is. He made me feel beautiful and accepted, perfect including my flaws. I felt confident and sexy in my body for the first time. But he took advantage of my sensuality and found it fun to exert his physical strength in order to get what he wanted from me: sex. He disregarded my boundaries. He felt entitled to do whatever he wanted just because he was stronger than me and could.\nI loved him and trusted him not to hurt me, but he did. His betrayal hurts the most because we shared so many intimate and vulnerable moments. I had love in my heart for him and I know in some (unhealthy) way he did too. I feel like an idiot for allowing myself to be vulnerable and open myself up to a fucking predator. I hate that his actions have affected the way I see relationships and how hard it is to be vulnerable and 100% all in again. \n\nMy heart hurts. My heart feels heavy from so much betrayal. My heart wants nothing more than to be open, free and loving again but it feels like the only way to get back there is through all the shit. But feeling all this betrayal and sadness hurts so much! I want to trust again but I don\u2019t know how. \n\nMy heart is broken and I just hope that this isn\u2019t the end of the journey. That my heart can be broken open. That there is some reason to this fucking madness. That I had to experience so much heartache in order to know the exact opposite of true, unconditional love and trust. And to find that again somehow.",

The chill went away instantly. But\u2019s sharp pain in the back of my head.  Is this all in my head?",

I\u2019ll try not to get too \u201cspiritual\u201d in nature, but for me, it\u2019s possible to be spiritual in a way that does not include belief in any God or outside force. To me, spirituality is about living in a way that is in balance with myself, others, nature, and existence itself. I have noticed that at times it is helpful to have the wisdom of others to support me along this journey of life. Does anybody else do this? If so, lemme know what that looks like for you. I\u2019m curious. \n\nI\u2019m a recovered alcoholic but have outgrown the rooms of AA.",

          "content": "I'm 22 years old, and for a long time now, I've had the feeling that my soul is constantly tormented, even tortured. I've never truly been \"happy\" or at peace with myself and the world around me. I've never been satisfied with my life, and I'm starting to wonder if true happiness is even possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm seriously questioning whether anyone in this world can genuinely be happy and fulfilled. I wonder if happiness is attainable for humans, who always seem to want more and are never content with their current situation. This perpetual desire has been essential for human survival and accomplishments, but it inevitably leads to suffering due to a sense of lack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm beginning to wonder if humans are destined to suffer indefinitely and if happiness is, in fact, just an illusion. This question troubles me even more in our current society, where I see few people truly happy. It's also possible that fulfillment doesn't lie so much in achieving desires but in the pursuit itself, which can briefly bring happiness. However, these moments of happiness are fleeting, and soon sadness, resentment, and other negative emotions take hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm becoming more and more confused, questioning why we live, work, and possess consciousness, and whether life has any meaning. It all seems absurd, especially when considering our insignificance on the cosmic scale and the transitory nature of our planet. So, we're condemned to act as though everything is normal, to get up every morning, go to work, knowing that each of our actions seems ridiculously insignificant. It's so absurd that it becomes almost comical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost people act as though everything is fine, because once you lift the veil of absurdity, it becomes challenging to function in society. Currently, I struggle to find the motivation to get up in the morning, take the subway, and work for what appears to be a purposeless endeavor. Some people turn to religion to escape this absurdity, but it seems both enviable and sad because they sacrifice their lives in the hope of a reward in the afterlife.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, life seems absurd, insignificant, and devoid of meaning, often filled with more suffering and sacrifice than moments of joy. I'm not sure if I'm going through depression, losing my mind, or experiencing what's called a \"dark night of the soul\" and a spiritual awakening. I hope that a spiritual awakening is real, but there's also the fear that I might simply be descending into madness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy identity has always been built on my academic achievements, often at the top of my class and excelling in scientific subjects. After high school, I enrolled in a prestigious engineering school, but I didn't last long. In class, I was already asking existential questions like, \"What's the point?\" \"Why is this useful?\" \"Why?\" The idea of spending the rest of my life studying or working seemed absurd, and I wondered if that was all life had to offer. I was disgusted and depressed, and I eventually gave up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still wonder if it was a mistake to drop out of university. On one hand, I think that if I had worked hard and obtained a good job, social status, a high salary, and the associated recognition, it might have spared me from asking all these existential questions that trouble me now. On the other hand, I fear that I wouldn't have found fulfillment as an engineer, and I would have lived a life of \"falsehood,\" or at least a life where I would be blind to the reality of existence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom this failure, my self-image has been shattered. Me, who was always brilliant in science, is now abandoning university. My ego is in tatters. In any case, one thing is certain: today, I'm lost. I don't know who I am, where I come from, why I'm conscious, and what life really is. And, most importantly, how can I continue to function in this world while pondering so many existential questions? It's absurd. I don't know why I'm posting this. Partly, it's to externalize my thoughts, write them down, clarify them, and organize them to better understand them. Partly, it's also because I'm seeking answers, even though I know the hope of finding them may be futile.",

It\u2019s human nature.) and so the human mind manifested these beings and objects. It turned out easier to blame these manifestations and thus we started to blame demons and possessions taking place instead of our own actions. Well since the human conscious has progressed, we no longer hallucinate and that\u2019s why it takes substances that lower our conscious to start hallucinating. But to speak on hallucinations with depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia it\u2019s because the person sits in despair constantly, and becomes inept and unable to control their own human conscious. This leads to the need for the brain chemicals to be balanced by pharmaceuticals that weren\u2019t available in the times of Jesus Christ, so that is another reason why we do not see the same kind of \u201cpossessions\u201d now, and when we do it\u2019s a mass murder or a gruesome, violent act done by someone who sat in despair.",

          "content": "Greetings, fellow seekers of self-knowledge and development of the self!\n\nToday, let's take a transformative visit inside of ourselves to explore the road of self-discovery and its tremendous effects on personal development.\n\n***1. Unveiling the Inner Journey:***\n\nThe inner voyage is an exploration of your own being, which is unexplored ground.\n\n  \nIt's a journey of self-discovery and self-awareness, an effort to comprehend the complexities of your ideas, feelings, and the core of who you really are.  \n\n\n***2. Why Start Your Inner Journey?***\n\nThe inner trip is essential for human development; it is not only a luxury. It acts as a compass to direct you toward a better knowledge of who you are, your goals, and your life's work.\n\n  \nIt gives you the ability to overcome challenges, develop resilience, and lead a more genuine and satisfying life.  \n\n\n***3. The First Step Is Self-Discovery***\n\nThe foundation of the inner journey is self-discovery. It entails meditation on oneself and the bravery to face one's strengths and faults.\n\n  \nTo unveil your genuine nature, you must strip away layers of conditioning and cultural expectations.  \n\n\n***4. Seeking Self-Awareness***\n\nThe prize you seek on the journey is self-awareness. It is the capacity to objectively observe your ideas, feelings, and behaviors.\n\n  \nYou develop an understanding of your habits, motives, and wants via mindfulness and introspection.  \n\n\n***5. Accepting Growth and Change***\n\nThe inevitable result of self-awareness and self-discovery is personal progress.  \n\n\nYour ability to adapt to change, overcome obstacles, and make decisions that are consistent with your real self improves as you become more aware of your inner landscape.  \n\n\n***6. Resources for Inner Growth***\n\nThere are several techniques and tools that may be used to go through the inner journey:\n\n**- Mindfulness:**  \nA method that fosters mental calmness, clarity, and increased self-awareness.\n\n  \n**- Journal writing:**  \nYou may see trends and keep a record of your own development by writing down your ideas and feelings.\n\n  \n**- Being mindful:**  \nYour ability to be totally in the moment might help you become more self-aware.\n\n  \n**- Looking for Advice:**  \nYou can use books, mentors, therapists, and spiritual practices as guidance along the way.  \n\n\n***7. Accepting What Is Unknown***\n\nThe inner journey doesn't follow a straight route to a predetermined endpoint. It's a spiral that pulls you more within.\n\n  \nYou could have times of deep insight, discomfort, and doubt along the road. Accept these experiences; they are a necessary component of transformation.  \n\n\n***8. Self-Compassion and Perseverance***\n\nBe kind and gentle with yourself while you travel the inner journey. It's good to make mistakes or distractions since growth takes time. Every step, no matter how tiny, counts as progress.  \n\n\n***9. Authenticity as a Gift***\n\nThe inner path ultimately brings you to the priceless gift of authenticity. Your ideals, purpose, and genuine self grow more in line with one another.\n\n  \nYou operate from a position of honesty and power inside.  \n\n\nThe inner journey is an ongoing process of self-discovery and development that lasts a lifetime. Moments of self-realization, empowerment, and change occur on this voyage.\n\nSo, dear visitors, may your inner voyage bring you insight, strength, and a closer relationship with the lovely soul within.",

I just know it\u2019s there.\u00a0\n\nI have been dealing with a great amount of emotional turmoil from my relationships and I desperately need healing for the rejuvenation to come back into myself. I often feel empty, isolated & drained of energy + emotion; But I have no one close to understand what I\u2019m going through. This perpetuates my feelings of being lost and left alone to struggle in the confusion. I feel like a fire slowly being put out. But I\u2019m frantic to find some sense of direction and safety before my fire completely goes out.\n\nI don\u2019t have anyone in my life to ask these questions as I am made to feel crazy for wanting to follow this spiritual path. But I deeply want this and long for an understanding of higher knowledge. I want to connect with higher power to help guide me into the person I'm meant to be in this lifetime. I would really benefit from that atm.\n\nI don't think I have ever felt a connection with any spiritual beings, or that my calls to higher power have been answered in a way I could identify. I don\u2019t see entities per se; But I do have dreams nearly every night. Nothing fun and trippy I don't think, I usually cant remember them when I wake up, unless I wake up and sleep again. So I think I'm starting at the bottom as far as intuition loll. But I continue to observe my surroundings all the time for something unnatural and enlightening, in case they're feeling jumpy that day.\u00a0\n\nI want to relearn & get to know myself in order to nurture my soul into bringing light and positivity to everything it touches. I know I am capable of getting back to a happy healthy mindset that would cultivate this. I want to share my love and not let it fade away from the pain I\u2019ve felt from solitude. Nevertheless, I want to connect with something much greater than myself and find purpose, light, love, meaning, peace and happiness (and much more). I know this is my next step & I\u2019ve been putting it off for so long thinking it may find me. I can't wait longer, I need a change. I'm ready to practice and sacrifice for my betterment. I just want to make the right moves and know what I may be missing going into this journey. So, how do I get there?\n\n~ If you were able to bear with me through some of my deepest unspoken thoughts, thank you so very much for reading\u2764\ufe0f. I truly believe I came to the right subreddit with this, and for my first serious Reddit post! I\u2019m so happy to share with this community. I know those I hope to connect with are listening, please don\u2019t hesitate to share any information at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to message me as well! I will be waiting in anticipation. sending love from op \ud83d\udc95~\n\u00a0\n\u00a0",

          "content": "Hello, I want to share that I found a new way to open up chakras but I don't know if this technique will work for other people like it did for me but I'll share it anyway and it's really simple. I was able to talk to my spirit guide by sending them thoughts in my head. I didn't have to go into meditation or any trance state at all. I always thought that opening up my chakras would be difficult for me because I have lived with a very bad diet eating low vibrational foods all my life but I don't think that diet matters for chakra activation now, at least for me. I told my spirit guide telepathically in my head \"please open up my chakras, I am ready now\" and it's very clear that they heard me even though I had no prior relationship with my spirit guide before. The next day after I did this I noticed that my back and head had begun to tingle very intensely throughout the day even at work and in class. I then began seeing spirits much clearer also when I became alone. Prior to this I was only able to see spirits in my peripheral vision but now I can see spirits very clearly since my guide has opened up my chakra channels. The spirit guide looks like a white humanoid figure that I've seen many times in my peripheral vision in the past, I can also see other spirits that have a black form now too. My spirit guide tries to tap on the walls to get my attention and also to answer yes and no questions. The spirit also is able to manipulate technology and it lowers the volume on my TV and it also shuts it off. However I have noticed that my spirit guide kept invading my space. They keep having their energy go into me and they change the temperature of the air around me so that it feels a little colder and the spirit also pokes me on the head and back at times. I can hear small glimpses of its voice and it constantly made my ears ring because it just kept changing it's frequency and it knew I was getting scared of it so it tried to make its voice less scary sounding. I telepathically asked it to stop invading my space yesterday and it has seemed to keep a distance from me now. I had a reading done by a trusted medium and they said that my great, great, great, great grandfather is my spirit guide and that they opened up my chakra channels because I had asked them to and that the spirit simply wants to talk to me and help me on my spiritual path. Is what I did a normal way of opening up my chakras and to also gain spiritual mediumship abilities. Now whenever I think of the word \"spirit\" my head begins to tingle because my guide always thinks that I'm trying to communicate with it even at times when I'm not. Can other people try what I did to see if it works with opening up chakra channels? Also what do people here think of this?",

          "content": "About a month ago, I went through I guess what you could call a midlife crisis. But it seemed more severe than that. Some bad luck kind of shook me into a depressed state, and I kept crying daily with no control. It felt like my actual worldly problems didn't matter much anymore and I just felt so empty. I kept asking myself what the point of anything was and I was actually feeling a bit suicidal. \n\nThis went on for about two weeks and slowly got better. However, it seems to have started my journey towards becoming spiritually awakened. I feel that there has been a massive shift in me, and I still struggle toward the next steps. I do feel a little more hopeful and optimistic. I came across this subreddit and saw some of the things people were saying, and it sort of clicked for me that this is what I'm going through. I believe I was so depressed because I thought that I had basically reached the end of everything that matters. I guess like I've been living in this happy/oblivious snow globe, and I finally got to the outskirts of it. To be honest, I've always felt this way deep down, but I shut it up with over working myself and keeping busy. Now these feelings are coming back up so loud that I cannot ignore them any longer. And to be honest, I don't think I even want to go back to my oblivious, mediocre life. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar. And if you could help me with what next? I read a lot of the posts on here, and I feel like a lot of you are much further along in your journeys that I don't necessarily understand it all. Any guidance would be much appreciated. Thank you.",

I was with my daughter (1 year old) and my ex (her dad) whom I have zero romantic feelings for. He was flirting with some girl in a cafe (this is what he's like in rl) so I walked out of the cafe and onto a seafront with my daughter in my arms and a large dog jumped up and bit my daughters neck. The owner ran off as I was shouting to call an ambulance so I ran back to my ex to call one and then I woke up. I've now had anxiety all morning and can't stop thinking about it.

          "content": "I\u2019ve decided to break of my fwb relationship w my best friend of almost ten years. I (25F) met my best friend (26M) in high school. We were strictly platonic since we both were in relationships. After some time, our relationships had ended. We started having a sexual relationship for about a few months. After those months, we went no contact for nearly two years. He lived his life, I lived mine. We reconnected in 2020 after I asked to speak to him. We were just friends for about a year before we rekindled our sexual relationship. We\u2019ve always had our inconsistencies, so once again we went no contact for a month or two. AGAIN we met back up and stayed solid for just shy of one year. Continuing to have sex. I just felt so comfortable with him. I gained a lot of weight during 2020, and he never made me feel undesirable. In fact, he was even more attracted to me. (I gradually lost some weight over time) During 2022, you guessed it, we went no contact. Four months. Within those 4 months, I met a man (25 at the time) on a dating site and hit it off really well. Good conversation, similar interest, same love for deadpan, dry humor- I just thought he was just so pleasant. I got a chance to click with someone new. That changed everything. Fast forward to October, I see my best friend (let\u2019s call him Harold) at a party. Harold is a DJ, so this was no surprise. We start speaking again in November. We have sex almost immediately. Why am I doing this? Security, predictably, and an itch needed to be so desperately. I also was in love with him. What can I say? He always tried his best to understand me. Never made me feel unwanted. We were best friends. However, I always knew something was not right. It never felt right. But, I always tried to make it work. We have such good chemistry. Just between you and I, he was never able to satisfy me. \u201cSo why did you keep going back?\u201d Like I said, security. Fear out of being with someone new. I was also IN LOVE. Unfortunately, after each romping, I started to grow bored with it. Just in time for dating app dude to say he\u2019s going to be in the area of my city, and he wants to see me. Let\u2019s call him Caleb. After almost a year of us being internet friends with a heavy overlay of sexual tension, we were going to see each other. I had to see him. We met, we talked, we indulged in alcohol, kisses were given, clothes came off and we did exactly what you\u2019re thinking \u2026 and it was fucking great. \u201cSo now what?\u201d Well, that\u2019s it. Caleb went his way, I went mine. Now, after this I went celibate for approximately 4 months. I was not giving Harold sex. I was so uninterested after what I had gotten. During this time, my eyes were starting to open to his and I\u2019s situation. I started to see him differently. He\u2019s quite pessimistic, unlucky, anxious and very unhealed. But this is still my friend. This is my friend that reminds me too much of the bad in myself. And that is precisely the problem. I started to understand that this might be a karmic connection. I found my stagnancy, trauma, fear, laziness being enabled, fueled, and mirrored back to me. Misery loves company, right? On September 3, 2023, my grandparents house caught fire. My grandfather was transported to an advanced hospital to be treated. My grandmother, very unfortunately, didn\u2019t make it. And guess what happened? Harold and I had sex. Maybe I needed to feel comfort and passion. No, it was NOT good. The norm. 12ish seconds. No redemption round. What was I expecting anyway? Two weeks later, we had a minor disagreement. Instead of us talking it out, he stopped speaking to me. Two weeks of nothing. I tried to speak to him. He denied it. Okay, fuck you too then. We laid my grandmother to rest September 25th. This changed my outlook on life. I started observing everything, everyone around me. Then I got angry. My best friend hasn\u2019t even checked on me? A few days ago, I get a text. \u201cI would like to speak to you.\u201d Harold. Demanding. No humility. No \u201chey, i know you\u2019ve seen your grandma for the last time and she\u2019s dead are you okay?\u201d I press and hold the thread. \u201cDelete thread?\u201d It\u2019s gone. All the jokes, emojis, memes, voice notes. Vanished. I\u2019m okay if I never see him again. I don\u2019t care to. I have to break the cycle. Pour into myself. Drop the bad habits that would\u2019ve had company with his. The plant trying to nurture will never grow under his dark cloud. So, I let him go. And I choose me.",

The experience itself isn\u2019t relevant but the question is. \n\nI was curious on everyone\u2019s opinion of Random Chance or Fate. Whos to say that a major moment in your life was Fate rather than random chance. Are some things meant to happen while others are simply random and if so how could you tell the difference. If something is Fate then why is it or vice versa? \n\nI know this is largely based off of personal beliefs but it\u2019s an interesting question to ponder.",

Recently however I've been seeing them more frequently, idk if it was just the weather or something but it seemed out of the ordinary to me, on top of the dragonflies I was now seeing not being the usual green but a brightish red. I didn't think anything of it. I had pretty good days when I saw them on my ways to work. ( I walk to work) another thing is it feels like whenever I do saw them they always made sure I noticed them.\nLike fly in my path stop and however until I noticed, then after I did would leave. Or even more bizarre is, for me I walk a lot looking at the ground so you'd think I miss them sometimes right? No, they fly in a way where they're shadow would be casted where I'm looking down at then id notice them, and yet again they'd leave after I did. However the most out of the ordinary thing happened the other day, I didn't just see one or two on my way back from my work, I saw like a entire group there was easily over ten to fifteen flying around in this little area on my path. Not annoyingly either they were just there, they also didn't fly away when I noticed them(which tbh even knowing me it would've been hard to miss them) I just didn't really know how to take it then but I thought to ask because it's been sticking with me sense.",

Extra weird the first time I heard it I was leaving my grandmothers grave after just spending quiet time with her during the full moon. I mean I felt an energy like no other but I thought it was because of the moon. Because I was extremely relaxed I wanted just to lay next to the grave and look at the moon. Weirder it was pouring raining got to her grave it stopped then the moon was covered with clouds then when my body & soul was relaxed the moon shone through the black clouds. I just thought it was beautiful.  Then afterwards I got in the car checked my ig. The first post I saw on my timeline was talking about the Thin Unveiling. Everyday since I\u2019ve seen this \u201cVeiling\u201d in or on something. Or is this something because of Halloween? If anyone knows about this and can enlighten me. I am All ears.",

First time poster here.\n\nI am hoping someone might be able to give me insight on my current situation. \n\nI had a spiritual awakening almost a year ago and have done my own studying/research on spirituality, existence, oneness, the Divine (or whatever you prefer to call it), energy, etc. and recently deeper topics like time, dimensions, quantum mechanics and it\u2019s tie to my beliefs. Although self-study and discovery is great, I am really lacking in the support part of all of this.\n\n I have tried talking to family and friends about my thoughts, experiences and beliefs and just about everyone thinks I\u2019m off my rocker to some extent. I love groups like this and I following a lot of spirituality pages that I feel a sense of community in but I really wish there was an in-person place to go and discuss these things. My friend invited me to her Christian church a few times and I joined for the experience but it doesn\u2019t fit me because I don\u2019t believe exactly what they do. I believe Jesus was a real enlightened person and that the Bible is a book of real experiences (and a lot of metaphors) but it just doesn\u2019t feel right. I have never considered myself \u201creligious\u201d and I\u2019ve never conformed to any religions before. The only religion i ever felt connected to was Buddhism but even then, it just didn\u2019t feel right. \n\nAnyways- here\u2019s the point of my post. Are there groups of people that study this stuff in-person? Is there a \u201cchurch\u201d that encompasses what we believe? I want to connect with people with my same beliefs in a community like people do at church. I want to be taught more from people that know more than me, not just posts online. \n\nI found a church called Unity that is the closest thing to my beliefs that I can find in my area but even then, it\u2019s a little too \u201creligious\u201d for me. \n\nI would appreciate any insight, advice or suggestions. \n\nThank you!!!",

I estimated that I consumed 10-12g of mushrooms. I had done micro dosing often and full 5-7g trips. My friends would get funky colours, patterns moving and all the \u201cnormal\u201d stuff. At first I would get them too but I soon got fractal \u201cwalls\u201d in my vision. Then eventually I saw sacred geometry making up everything in the room. It was faint and I would still be able to comprehend a wall, ceiling, table etc. \n\nThis 10-12g trip was intense\u2026 \nI was hanging out in my backyard with my friend. We were talking and I looked towards the trees. Everything seemed to have a linear pattern. Like we were living in a simulation. I didn\u2019t think much of it and tried to have a good time. Then all of a sudden reality outside became linear 3 dimensional grey with a sacred geometry symbol stacked linear but also moving. I couldn\u2019t see where I was but my friend brought me inside the house. I couldn\u2019t see anything in the room as a \u201cnormal\u201d object. Unless I shook my head back and forth. I didn\u2019t feel scared but I had a feeling like I wasn\u2019t supposed to see this. I kept looking at my friend and saying \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to see this, I shouldn\u2019t be able to see this.\u201d I felt like I was looking into the \u201cfabric of reality\u201d. Finally I came down and felt an overwhelming sense that everything is going to be okay. Mundane things don\u2019t matter and to just enjoy the time I have here. \n\nA few days later I decided to try and find the sacred geometry symbol I saw. I found the dodecahedron which is \u201cdivine ether\u201d. \nI want to know if anyone else has seen what I\u2019ve seen on psychedelics? The closest way for me to describe it as cheesy as it sounds would be the \u201cmatrix\u201d but replace the 001001110 with the dodecahedron.",

Little longer she stops her self and comes back inside, the man geabbed my moms arm when she closer to the table and he said \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mean to upset that much, I just have to tell you something\u2019s. I have a message\u201d Saying \u201cMy head has really been hurting me today like badly, did your mother pass away from a brain aneurysm?\u201d My mom slowly says yes she said how did you know\u2026 Then he goes on about \u201cYou had 4 people in the room when she passed didn\u2019t you?\u201d Yes (ME MOM UNCLE AUNT) The he starts talking about me going off about me described me so so damn perfect my mom said.. the dude was the same age as my gma too. The he brought up the damn bird and said that bird visiting you was your mother saying goodbye. Then went ok about how my gma is using my moms body as a portal\u2026 Meaning my gma is living inside my mom. Saying have you been eating a lot more and smoking a lot more\u2026 that\u2019s because your doing for two you and your mother\u2026 Then later goes on about his message saying \u201cI\u2019m truly sorry again about this and your loss, know she\u2019s at peace and always with you\u201d\n\nKnow we have never meet this man in our life, would carry a walmart bag with mail inside and smelt like he was homeless.

A complete 180 from a year ago.\n\nI just received news that my spirit guide is not content with everything and wants more from me. I was introduced to my guide a year ago during a time of my life when I was very guarded, and was overwhelmed to say the least. Not only had I never heard of a spirit guide, but I found out mine was Aphrodite, a literal goddess, and boy I felt the pressure. She has only communicated to me with words through others, some are friends and others are random strangers, but usually the strangers are her way of sending an SOS and I know at this point, and it hasn\u2019t happened for a while!\n\nI feel her signs, I\u2019ve been open, feeling the love and want to LISTEN more, but don\u2019t know what more I can do. She\u2019s impatient (not my personal words but she actively tells this to others) but I would love to make her proud.\n\nIf anyone has any advice to open up the communication and be more open would be appreciated. Again, I have never felt so in tune and open, so to hear she was not content and impatient for me to get on board today caught me off guard! Any insight would be amazing and I so appreciate you all \ud83d\udc9b\ud83e\udd79",

          "content": "Please hear me out and if this post doesn\u2019t make sense, please let me know so I can try to simplify it.   \n   \nTwenty years ago I had this manic vision wherein Einstein visited me and said \u201ceverything is relative.\u201d  The vision was incredibly clear, and I felt called to interpret what he meant by that.  I didn\u2019t have any education in physics and it wouldn\u2019t really make sense that I should go learn the subject since I have ADD, bipolar, and many symptoms of autism.  So I went rogue and just let fate decide if anything would come of it.   \n   \nI scribbled thousands of notes and graphs trying to give values to things like god and personality and rocks and poetry.   I never gave up, and in the end, I solved the theory of everything.  \n   \nThe turning point was when I questioned whether Einstein had told me \u201cEverything is relative\u201d or if he meant or said \u201cEvery \u2018thing\u2019 is relative.\u201d  Once I started thinking about what defines a \u201cthing,\u201d or object (I use these interchangeably), I realized that nouns are not what they seem.   \n   \nNouns describe a set of characteristics of something or some set of things that someone recognizes as an object (such as a car made up of parts).  I expanded the definition of object to include all possible things with characteristics to leave nothing out (including people and places).    \n   \nNouns are a convenience to human language, but super computers can communicate observations without naming the object, and instead just describing the object\u2019s characteristics, including actions.   So what does this all mean?   \n   \nThe \u201ctheory of every thing\u201d is that every thing shares all the same characteristic bands/spectrums with everything else (\u201cevery thing is relative\u201d along these bands).  As it turns out, \u201cevery thing is also distinct\u201d (can be assigned an identifying label: name or noun) because no things can have the same exact values for each characteristic at a given time.  For example, no two atoms take the same space at the same time.\n   \nWhat is the characteristic band you might wonder?  Basically, there are no adjectives or adverbs that don\u2019t contrast against their opposites.  Hot vs cold.  Empathy vs narcissism.  Hard vs soft.  Further, there are always gradients.  In fact, you don\u2019t need to find a word like \u201cwarm\u201d to show gradience between hot and cold.  You can just say less hot, or less cold, or assign a point scale to temperature.  These gradients form a spectrum and I like to call these spectrums \u201cbands.\u201d   \n   \nSo how is this theory of everything useful?  Well, I\u2019m glad you asked.  All problems and all solutions are objects per my definition, and therefore, they all have these characteristic bands.  You assign a scale to these bands, and identify the value for each \u201crelevant characteristic\u201d of a problem.  That becomes the identification number for the problem.  Then you use math to run variable analysis on the relevant characteristics to create a list of potential solutions.  And then you evaluate the solutions, again, mathematically.  Every possible object is a solution to any problem, but there are a limited number of objects that are a great solution.  A rock is a solution to almost every problem if thrown hard enough (a rock wiped out all the dinosaurs problems, for example).  You are trying to run an analysis that optimizes the solutions.    \n   \nFor people with incredible imaginations, because they have been manic all their lives and live in imaginary Earthsuits (the most mobile and resource preserving of homes) in imaginary Neverlands.. (ok, it might just be me).. we are able to invent anything in our minds as long as we have the knowledge of what the characteristics of the problem are.  Sometimes the solution requires that we add parts or introduce another object into the equation.  To invent, we need to be aware of or formulate those characteristics and potential objects too.   \n    \nThe only way that I believe this theory can be refuted successfully is if someone can come up with a true binary set of adjectives (or other characteristic) where \u201cless of x\u201d or \u201cmore of x\u201d is not possible.  I asked ChatGPT for an example of something that is binary and it said an on and off light switch.  That\u2019s true that the on/off switch has two states.. on or off.  But I can think of two ways that an on-off switch is not binary.    \n   \nFirst, if you are switching the light off, the mechanism is in a state of motion that goes from furthest possible away from off, to closer and closer to off, to off, and then furthest position away from on.  That is a spectrum.  Next, we are talking about light switches.. can you think of a light switch that isn\u2019t limited to two states?  That\u2019s right, a dimmer switch.  Another spectrum.  So in fact, all possible light switches are on a spectrum and the two-state on/off switch is just one of many.  \n    \nThe spiritual awakening is that I believe much more in my imagination and in developing my intuition through this tool, which represents the underlying framework of everything we can perceive.   \n    \nLastly, if you have any science background, you might be saying to yourself, the \u201cgrand unification theory\u201d has nothing to do with all of this.   And, you are mostly correct.  Physicists are searching for a formula that conveys an over-arching calculation for the forces of the universe.  What I have solved is grander because it applies to every subject, not just physics.  Every banded characteristic is it\u2019s own dimension for example.  And there are thousands of known characteristics.  Physicists only recognize 3d space and time.  I\u2019m not here to argue, just to share what Einstein showed me.",

I never really thoughr anything of it because it happend maybe 3 times in 18 years. Then i met a now good friend, which i could feel very well. By that i mean i could feel when he would text me or arrive by my hous. Strange for me but whatever right? It was just an imteressting funny thing that happend to me so i laughed it off. I had a dream of a painting and it felt so real, 2 years later i met my now bestfriend. The painting was in here house. I was so shocked. And then i slept with a coworker of mine, at first it was all perfect but it ended as fast as it started, here my problem.\n\nI began to feel him in my heart, i thought maybe he thinks about me or something but he made clear he didnt like me in that way. Later i learnd that i feel his pain... i feel his heart ache, when he's sad or just down. I talked to him about it and he also laughed it off, he believed it because i knew to much about his pain and the time and date for it to be BS.\n\nAnd the problem is its getting more and more and i don't know what to do with it. Now i feel him in my heart, my stomach, my brain i even feel like sometimes i see how he lays in his bed. And something really strange happend.\nI dreamed about a childhood experience he had. A traumatic one. I asked him because that just couldn't be true... but it was. I saw the futer sometimes yes, but NEVER a memory frome someone else. I wasn't even born when it happend.\n\nMy question is... why do i feel this? Why me? Do i need to help him? Do we belong together? Could it be that he wished for someone to understand him or sth? \nI don't get it and i just wanna know why. Im tired of it.\n\nThank you so much for reading and your help",

It feels like a whole new world has opened up to me, and my perspective on life and the world has drastically changed. Previously, I was always curious and sought out more and more information, particularly about the afterlife. I listened to various spiritual gurus online and read numerous books in search of peace, with a focus on creating the life I desired.\n\nWhile I did achieve some material goals, I found myself dwelling in negativity. My emotions became more intense; for instance, if I felt angry before my spiritual awakening, it was amplified tenfold afterward. I made efforts to shift towards a positive outlook by engaging in good habits like going to the gym, running, and exploring new hobbies, but it seemed like the majority of my feelings were negative. Experiencing glimpses of happiness became rare.\n\n&#x200B;",

          "content": "Hi everyone, hope you are all having a good day. This year I have experienced a spiritual awakening (or re-awakening) after quitting my job that was causing me severe burnout. \n\nThis will be a bit of a long post but I hope someone out there will have the energy to stick around. \n\nI was raised in an environment of fear, negativity and very low vibration. I was the oldest so responsible from the age of 4 or 5 for taking care of my mom's extreme anxiety disorder and talking her down from her daily fears for her and our family. My siblings were protected from this side of things, while I was brought in to be her therapist and also mediate the marital issues between my mom and dad. \n\nI know it is part because I am a natural leader and am a smart and quick person. So my mom and parents gravitated towards me since a young child to tell them what to to do in their life emergencies. It taught me to be a leader from a young age, and also be a very powerful empath. I don't know how much was nature versus nurture, but I learned how to perceive people's real emotions, and predict how anyone would act in any situation in order to anticipate these emergencies. This benefited me and led to track record of top grades in university and a track record of always being successful and being promoted \"historically quickly\" in jobs and very rapid career advancement. It it also left me with a lot of unacknowledged trauma. My family is extremely enmeshed. \n\nI always had some connection to the spiritual. By the time I was 7 I would have panic attacks at night about the idea of death. I would also be haunted or visited by spirits. I would hear them walk around bed so distinctly. I had several very inexplicable experiences. I also felt a connection to the divine. It felt like a very distinct memory that I was from the stars. \n\nI surpressed this until this year. My life and career burnout was so extreme that I broke off everything. Quit my career. Cut out toxic friends. Established healthy yet empathetic boundaries with family. I feel happier and more fulfilled and free than ever. I know without a doubt I'm on the right path. \n\nMy spiritual awakening happened after this. I felt my connection with high vibration. Letting go of negative emotions. Being 100% authentic, trying new creative endeavours and following my heart and passion and feeling the connection to source.  I also connected to my grandfather as a spirit guide. It was unexpected. But in retrospect he was very successful and fulfilled and was clearly so connects to source and such a beautiful, quiet, good man. \n\nBUT I have this very profound instinct that my spiritual journey's next step is to physically face the physical manifestation of some type of negative energy, spirit, etc. that has been around me my whole life. I feel myself resisting facing this moment happening from fear. I can just tell something very physical and scary is going to happen to me as my next step. And I am scared I must face it to advance on my path. But I am scared. I'm sleeping with the lights on and avoiding moments of alone in the darkness when I think it will happen. \n\nBut another part of me knows I have to let this happen to move beyond it to this place of abundance and confidence. It is my ultimate battle with fear that I must face to advance. I know fear is a vibration. I know I am meant to do good things and help many others. But I am still scared. \n\nI am just hoping the right person finds this crazy long post and gives me some guidance. Facing some physical manifestation of fear is reactivating all this fear in me I am trying to let go of. \n\nFor anyone who read this. Thank you. I really needed to be heard by some other spirit. And I love you. Because we are both a part of the same source.",

A Joyful Start to Morning Meditation***\n\n  \nSpend a few minutes in meditation in the morning. Locate a peaceful area, shut your eyes, and concentrate on your breathing.\n\n  \n***\u201cMindfulness, clarity, and a sense of serenity are all developed by meditation. It serves as a gentle reminder to begin each day with presence and intention.\u201d***\n\n  \n***2. Count Your Blessings in a Journal of Gratitude***\n\n  \nEvery morning, take a few minutes to write down a few things for which you are thankful. \u201c***Writing in a gratitude diary encourages optimism and redirects your attention to the richness in your life.\u201d***\n\n  \nIt's a lovely way to begin the day with a heart full of gratitude.\n\n  \n***3. Affirmations as Self-Belief Fuel***\n\n  \nRecite affirmations that are in line with your ambitions and goals.\n\n  \n***\u201cThese motivating quotes can increase your self-esteem, alter your perceptions, and create an upbeat mood for the rest of the day.\u201d*** If you believe in your affirmations, others will as well.\n\n  \n***4. Nourish Your Body and Soul with Mindful Eating***\n\n  \n***\u201cAlways eat mindfully, whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Enjoy every bite, focusing on the tastes, textures, and experiences.\u201d***\n\n  \nIn addition to nourishing your body, mindful eating helps you stay in the present.\n\n  \n***5. Earthly Reverence: Nature Connection***\n\n  \nIf you can, spend a little time each day in the outdoors.\n\n  \n***\u201cNature delivers a profound sense of grounding and spiritual connection, whether you're taking a walk in the park, taking care of your garden, or just staring up at the sky.\u201d***\n\n  \n***6. Show kindness by sharing love***\n\n  \nEvery day, carry out a random act of kindness. \u201c***It could be as straightforward as a smile, a nice word, or a little helping hand.\u201d***\n\n  \nKindness not only makes someone else's day better, but it also fills your own spirit with satisfaction.\n\n  \n***7. Evening Reflection: Learn the Lessons of the Day***\n\n  \nSpend some time thinking back on your day before going to sleep. \u201c***What did you discover? What difficulties did you resolve? What are you appreciative of?\u201d***\n\n  \nYou develop an understanding of your experiences and a sense of closure via this exercise.\n\n  \n***8. Calming Down at Night: Get Ready for Serene Sleep***\n\n  \nEstablish a restful bedtime regimen. These rituals let your body and mind know that it's time to relax, whether it's through reading, mild stretching, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n  \n***\u201cFor spiritual development and personal transformation, quality sleep is essential.\u201d***\n\n  \n***9. Self-Compassion: Acknowledge Your Imperfections***\n\n  \n***\u201cPractice self-compassion all day long. When things don't go according to plan, be kind to yourself.\u201d***\n\n  \nRecognize that you are growing and that obstacles are merely chances for learning and improvement.\n\n  \n***10. Plan your path when setting intentions.***\n\n  \nSet a clear intention each morning before you start your day. \u201c***What do you hope to achieve? How would you like to feel?\u201d***\n\n  \nYour actions are guided by your intentions, which keep you focused on your objectives.  \n\n\nThese daily practices are more than just routines; they are effective means of fostering both \u201c***personal*** and ***spiritual development.\u201d***\n\nThey support the development of \u201c***mindfulness***, ***gratitude***, ***self-awareness***, and ***a stronger bond\u201d*** between you and the people and things in your environment.\n\nYou will learn that transformation is a wonderful and ongoing process of self-discovery and growth as you incorporate these practices into your everyday life.",

Some of brave souls decided to be born into families which carrying faulty blood lines to heal the lineage, for example maybe many generations joined wars and therefore a heavy energy runs in the family.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to sacrifice your free will for any of your family members or anyone at all to give up on chasing for the life you truly desire. You are the one who is responsible for your own life, not anyone else\u2019s.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to grasp and not letting go of how your family member hurt you, as it will deeply drown you into victim mentality. You agreed to learn lessons with them or from them and some of you, for example females, still choose to be born with feminine energy to help balancing Earth, knowing patriarchy and discrimination she will be facing.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to feel as if you owe them anything, a new family member should be born with blessings and unconditional love from parents, and that they willingly choose to raise you up and nurture you with love.\n\nSadly, there\u2019s still parents on this planet that only see their children as a \u2018annuity plan\u2019. They make children feel guilty by always exaggerating how hard it was to raised them up or how much they have given up on their lives, as if they would lead a successful life or live better without having children.\n\nMy dear child, if you were born in such family, it was never your fault and you need to stop blaming yourself and to see what kind of people you parents truly are, behind the vail of abusing you in the name of \u2018love\u2019.\n\nMy dear child, sometimes we letting go of the past doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it was okay for them to treat you wrongly, but is for you to not being punished by other\u2019s faults. It will only bring you more harm than what you\u2019ve already experienced, don\u2019t allow yourself to keep drowning in darkness and sadness, it\u2019s time for you to step forward and live your life and shine you own beauty.\n\nThere\u2019s so much views on this planet waiting for you to explore, and you were never a \u2018damaged goods\u2019 just because of your experience. You\u2019re a strong and beautiful soul, you\u2019re way beyond those barriers that you are facing right now, you have the ability to heal the traumas and to start a new life and to meet new people who is willing to love you unconditionally.\n\nThere\u2019s a saying on Earth, \u2018life is too short to be wasted\u2019, I\u2019m not completely agree with it since there\u2019s no single day in your life that was wasted. All the experience, positive or negative, lead you to the place you are and shape you into the person you are today. On the soul level you were never truly hurt.\n\nmessage from the archangel ~ Ambassador of Light, channelled  by  SiHeng",

          "content": "I recently got myself a shadow work journal and it completely changed my life. I was going through such an intense dark night of the soul I did not know what to do with myself. I couldn't afford therapy anymore and it wasn't helping anyway. I decided to start journalling and writing my feelings out and that helped a bit.\n\nEventually, I got fed up and decided to buy a journal with guided shadow prompts. The prompts were a bit triggering but it turns out it was exactly what I needed, a safe space to let everything out. It resulted in a lot of tears but for the first time, I felt like I was healing.\n\nAfter about a month of shadow journalling, I woke up one day and everything felt different. I felt like I was no longer fearful because I could see that everything \"outside\" of me was just a reflection of what I was dealing with inside. I learned that while I was trying so hard to stay positive and hold it all together, I wasn't allowing myself to accept fully and heal. I was suppressing my emotions which just made everything worse.\n\nI read too that Eckhart Tolle had his spiritual awakening through acceptance of his pain. I feel like in the spiritual community there is so much pressure to just \"stay positive\" and to \"focus on the good\" but that's just not possible until you accept your present moment. I feel like we have missed half the message and the key to liberation is actually shadow work. \n\nI also feel it's important to find the method of shadow work that works best for you. For me personally, it was journalling and writing things out. For others that may be tonglen meditation, talk therapy, or maybe physical exercise.\n\nYou can just journal in an empty notebook like I used to or you can get a shadow work journal on Amazon (there are many, so be sure to choose the best one for you).\n\nThis is the one that I am currently using: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CHWG9QNT/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CHWG9QNT/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?ie=UTF8&qid=&sr=)\n\nI chose this one because it has exercises and journal prompts, and it was recommended to me by a close friend.\n\nAnyway, I hope this was able to help someone.

Different people and different places.\n\nThing is, I am from Gosport UK and my dreams are always set here. But it\u2019s like a wacky version of the place.\n\nAll the locations are warped versions of the places that exist in real life, whether they are significant to me or not. No matter what the dream is about or who is in it, the places I visit are always exactly the same to the fine details. The house I live in, my old school, college, leisure centre, woodlands, etc. even the routes I have to take are the same in every dream no matter what. Yet those places look absolutely nothing like they do in real life.\n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder why I know this place as well as I know my real life hometown. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019ve gone into another dimension because I am fully conscious of the fact I know where I am and I know my way around as well as I do in real waking life despite it looking so warped it\u2019s like something from an acid trip.\n\nI never want to have these dreams but they don\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m living a second life while I\u2019m asleep. It\u2019s as if I am awake.\n\nAlso note that I often see my dead relatives and pets but never see their faces. Not every time but it\u2019s semi frequent.\n\nI can visualise the entire dream version of gosport in my mind as I type this as if I just walked home from there now. It\u2019s fresh in my mind always and I know I will never stop going back there whether I want to or not.\n\nPlease help me I need your thoughts\n\n(Edit: to be clear, I used to have normal dreams until a few years ago. I know these are nothing like what I used to dream and I know how different it is from a normal dream)",

I had a spiritual awakening around the same time and I recognise that I have a lot more space to give to people. My friend and I are each others best friend. \n\nMy friend did a edmr therapy last week and the day after she was emotional and she came by to chill. We ate together and then I started doing the dishes. She was talking and I felt vaguely nauseas at a point where I kinda slowed down doing the dishes and contemplated if I should sit down for a bit. Not even a second later she said: \"fun part about edmr that Ive been nauseas all day\". I was surprised. I told her that I also felt a nauseas just now. I asked her if she felt a small headache behind her ears and she said she also felt pressure there. I could feel what she was feeling. \n\nAre there more people with this experience and what did it mean for you? \n\nThanks for reading. Lots of love and light <3",

After going through this for the better part of 6 months I find myself seeing a lot of spiritual videos on tik tok discussing the different steps and paths through your spiritual awakening. \n\nNow I know that everyone\u2019s journey is different and we shouldn\u2019t rely on what random people are saying online but I guess there\u2019s a little part of me inside that worries that what I went through the last 6 months and all the healing I did, was not actually my dark night but instead just another step leading up to it. Just 2 weeks ago I was still going through this so its still very fresh, knowing I went through this still feels so surreal. \n\nI guess I was just wondering if anyone had any insight they could provide or advice they could give of their own experiences/understanding.",

It was the beginning of my personal and spiritual development, which culminated in short-lived self-realization, liberation, enlightenment and ascension where for my 20th birthday (Jan. 4 2014) as gift from God & Jesus I experienced myself as One with God, where I have became \"I am that I AM\", just so I may have understanding of what it means and how it feels and what it implies to have the Christ Consciousness. By the Grace of God I was given this gift so in the future which is coming soon I may build a school and temple of God through which all the nations of the Earth may come to God by learning, experiencing and becoming One with God, through ASCENSION. The Temple of the 144k will be established in the upcoming years so all the children of the earth can ascend to Eternal Life, where all things will be possible, all miracles will be everyday thing through the Power of Infinite Love of our Maker. If 'sinner' and darkworker like myself could receive such a Great Love from God, so can anyone else, no matter who you are or what you have done in your life, forgive yourself and everyone else for everything you experienced in this lifetime, humble yourselves, and Ask, Seek, Knock!\n\nFor everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it is opened.

I have been witnessing all that has happened in your life, and now is the time for you to step forward into the next level of this healing journey.\n\nMy dear child, when I say stepping forward, it does not necessarily mean that you need to manage to do something remarkably to prove yourself to others. Instead, the next step of your healing process is to go further and look inside of your heart, the part where you don\u2019t show others, and tapping into the blocked energy, to see what\u2019s there waiting for you for a long time. We\u2019re now going to reveal your deepest secrets.\n\nWhat is shadow self? When we experiencing trauma in childhood or past lives, there\u2019s something in your heart that you choose to cover it deep inside, because it may cause you pain to even just think about it. And together these experiences hidden in the shadows is your shadow self.\n\nMy dear child, I know you may have asked many times \u2018Why me?\u2019, you may not yet understand the reason for you to experience the \u2018hardships\u2019 that normal people wouldn\u2019t be facing in their life.\n\nHowever, my dear child, everything that has happened in your life has happened for you with reasons and purposes. When you\u2019re yet to know the blueprint of your life, you may fall deep into believing that you are a victim.\n\nMy dear child, you\u2019re not a victim and those things in your life didn\u2019t happen for making you feel sad or heartbroken. These events help you to hold more compassion, love and empathy. It helps you to understand others, and through which, you expand your consciousness and heart energy.\n\nDon\u2019t run away from the shadow, the harder you try to run away from it, the tighter it will chase after you and influence you. Till you stop running and turning back to hug your shadow self, you will truly know how grand yourself is and that you were never truly wounded on a soul level.\n\nmessage from the archangel ~ Ambassador of Light, channelled  by  SiHeng",

However, are you on the right track to achieve this dream right now?\n\nWhen you only chasing after materialism and forget to connect with your inner wisdom from heart, all you can get is insecurity about unknown future and struggles to survive or even imagining of yourself in a endless competition with others for something empty and vain.\n\nJust like drowning in the ocean, people are just like this before they wakes up spiritually. The more they struggle, the more they are drowned. However, when you can clear your mind and open your heart, you can receive guidance from your higher self and most importantly, have inner peace. Through which, you will stop struggling in the water and then you will surprisingly realise that the water is holding you and now you are floating on the sea surface. The flow will bring you to where you need to go.\n\nmessage from the archangel ~ Ambassador of Light, channelled  by  SiHeng",

I got all wam and bubbly, my body locked up. then it was over. i was breathless. i got up walked in the living room. texted him asking if he was good. next thing i know my body is humming again, i feel this internal bliss almost and see a glowing gold light everywhere i look and i burst out into tears. i started to have all these memories pop up and then relief. i was just a shaking sobbing mess lol. ever since then my mind has been quiet for the first time in 16 years, my body doesn\u2019t hurt the way it use to. i just feel lighter.",

The base levels of religions all appear to be different. As you advance through the levels of religion, they start taking on similar meanings. Religion leads to spirituality and at the level of spirituality you are able to see the how all religions are the same. Religion separates humans into several groups of humans. Spirituality essentially shrinks religion into two groups of humans \"spiritual\" and \"nonspiritual\". \"Enlightenment\" is when you see there is no \"other\", duality vanishes and the is no more separation of anything. If you still see anything as \"other\" then you are still in the \"egoic\" dream of human and are not awake. When you see that there is no \"other\", you see there is nothing you need to do, since there are no \"others\" to save or help. There is no longer any attack, attack can only come from \"other\".",

It was time for me to heal, face hard truths, and release the scars from my child hood, that had been crippling me for years. Once I started to paint again, my heart chakra, and third eye started to open up.\n\nI started to receive an energy that flowed through me, giving me visions, and knowledge that couldn\u2019t have come from the human mind. I also learned that the Ego is one of the biggest downfalls that holds us back, from experiencing pure joy, and peace. \n\nI started to apply the knowledge I received and my whole life changed. I dived into the art world, painting like a madman. I couldn\u2019t stop because it felt so good, and I was releasing negative emotions that had been stored inside me for far too long.\n\nA lot of beautiful things have happened since then.  I met my soul mate and got pregnant, and amazing opportunities have come my way.  Now I operate at a higher consciousness level, spreading truths and God consciousness through my work.\n\nI can\u2019t express how important it is to use the gifts you have already been given from God, and how tapping into them and applying them, can bring the utmost happiness, fulfillment, and purpose to your life. \n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffcTap into your higher self, and Paint Your own Story. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f\n\n Follow me and get inspired today\ud83d\ude42Sign up and stay connected\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nwww.artwithevie.ca",

I also wonder could it have just been some type of childhood dream. But it felt too real to be a dream. I remember I was sitting down in an almost church like setting and what I think was a man with a very calming voice said come with me, he then took me over to what I recall looked like a box and said now look in here or something along them words. It was so long ago that I can\u2019t recall every detail but can anyone tell me why I have this memory and what this could be? Could this be me a memory of me passing away in a past life and god reincarnated me? I also had complications when I was first born and the drs had to do something that was like a spinal tap and there was a chance of me being paralyzed from this surgery thank god I was ok, it was mandatory or I would have had some type of problems my parents always say it was the scariest moment of their life because I was an infant and screaming crying I wonder could this have been the light that I remember seeing maybe the lord telling me it will all be ok I\u2019m just very confused of what this memory that has always been in my head is and wish I knew some type of answer of what this memory could have been it was almost like looking into a big metal box in a church as an infant or maybe passing away in a past life and after that I\u2019m\nNot sure what happened, has anyone else had.

          "content": "# One week Spiritual Recovery Plan\n\nThis is not Buddhism, but the truth of the states of mind we occupy.  Use it as the roadmap.  Jump down to the bottom first and learn the 10 worlds before reading.\n\nThe wetware in the body called the mind is not the real you, even if it malfunctions or is in a state of atrophy. Intermittent fasting, no sugar, improved diet and meditation can restart the engines. Then, **stay in a state of service to others, learning, and realization.** Get out the door and exercise your mind, body and soul.\n\nThe 10 worlds are the wonder nugget of inner engineering you must focus on first. Ego can trap you in the first four worlds and make you think you are worthless. Not true. Just look up above human and focus your awareness there.  Once you do, the mind engages into a resplendent quintessent lumiafarious ether bubble of goodness.\n\nDon't expect a constant warm and gooey feeling, but expect the ever-satisfying work of a farmer cultivating the garden.  You will be required to suffer the hoe, but all the good fruit starts dropping into your being all around you in the form of synchronicity and [unexpected movement inward, outward and upward.](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRichardTalkins/comments/16md0e4/one_spiritual_path_only_in_out_up/)\n\nWatch the wonder wetware come back online in a week of this path. Look below at the 10 worlds. Just maintain a focus on virtue development and learning. The lower 4 worlds will vanish. The upper will restart the light in the mind and lead you to the realized state of being, no matter your outer condition.\n\nIf you needed an explanation for why you feel so lifeless and lonely, this is it.  Stay out of the pit (world 1-4) and migrate into the upper 4 worlds of Heaven, Learning, Realization and Service to others.  It's called reaching to heaven for a reason.  All 10 are states of mind.  Buddha is possible, and as they say, ALL are Buddha.  Your higher nature is entangled into the Human, and 10 / 5 are the same person continually.  Simply discover the truth of this being: **resplendent quintessent lumiafarious ether bubble of goodness.**  There's a reason Buddha is fat and smiling on his seat.\n\nMeditate upon and learn these 10 worlds first. Realize which worlds you most occupy, then flip the narrative of who you are and become the nature of the world you wish to occupy.  True desire is the movement between worlds.  Identity is not the underworld below Human.\n\nThe **carryon** in your in-head storage compartment has the capacity to occupy 10 worlds, and if you occupy the lower four, you will miss the true meaning of heaven above you. If you didn't know already, this is the entire meaning of the Kansas Song, **Carryon My Wayward Son**.\n\n**Whirligig your wonder whiskers here first:**\n\n# 10 Buddha\n\n**9 Bodhisattva - Servant and True Being**\n\n**8 Realization**\n\n**7 Learning**\n\n**6 Heaven**\n\n# 5 Human\n\n**4 Anger**\n\n**3 Animality**\n\n**2 Desire**\n\n**1 Hell**",

The book I am reading is called \"The Game of Life and how to play it.\" \n\nIt is a short, simple and well explained book that answered many of the questions I had when I started my search for spiritual growth. I'm sure you can find it on Amazon.  \n\nI would like to ask those of you who feel they are on the path to spiritual awakening, have you felt like everything is pretty much pointless? Like, we're literally here to learn to be kind to other, to grow and help others grow, and to become better versions of ourselves and evolve. Yet pretty much everything we were taught is a lie! Have a good job, have money, have power, have this, have that, acquire as many things as you can, oh and with social media, we live in such a narcissistic society with a \"look at me\" \"look at my life\" \"look at my vacation spot\" \"look at how successful I am\" syndrome that completely stirs us away from our purpose! \n\nHow do we stay focus, yet motivated while unlearning all the bs we were taught?\n\n**1ReplyShare**  \n",

          "content": "So, this is a long story so I'm going to say it in the quickest way possible. My first awakening was induced by trauma and drugs. I didn't protect myself and something negative basically ruined my life because I stupidly (full of my self).told it that I will destroy it,well it destroyed me. So I put it behind me and ignored every sign l told myself non of it was real and I went back to sleep. But now I'm free from drugs and all I have been sober 2 years and I'm now having a spiritual awakening that I can't igmore, I asked the universe foe proof and it did. I had random people telling me things that then happened a few days later and then I went to my local crystal/incense shop looking for a crystal necklace for motivation and said I need none of that because I'm really strong, she then told me what I had been threw (again never met) then she told me that my purpose is to heal and I am a healer she said she could literally feel it beaming from me and had euphoria the whole time I was in the shop!! How exciting guys! Where do I go next?.how do I learn to use my healing abilities andnl would anyone like to be who I practice on for free? \ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc4b",

After more than a year off the pill my hormones had not adjusted. My testosterone was elevated and was dealing with hormonal acne, excessive hair growth. I chose to get on an anti-androgen medication (not birth control) to deal with acne and hair growth. \n\nMy levels are fine now and there is a decrease in acne and hair growth - not gone completely. I\u2019ve noticed meditation has been off and I do not connect to Spirit as easily as I used to. Used to get consistent downloads and felt awakened. I find myself second guessing my intuition and have been feeling stuck. I\u2019m considering stopping it to get back on path. I feel like I gave into vanity and wondering if my hormones would have adjusted after giving it more time off pill and with new diet (pescatarian). \n\nAny advice? Or do things slow down as part of awakening? TIA",

          "content": "I wanted to share about love.\n\n \n\nWhat is Love?\n\nA lot of people know of the mentality of love in which describes a way of Love. Free and fun-loving is what some might point towards and living with care and kindness within our lives can be a loving way to live. This is not just a starting point but rather a home for how we want to operate at times. There is also potentially a literal mentality energy in regards to that of love pertaining to the overlapping layers on our head area is sometimes discerned by psychics and things of that nature. There is many other kinds of compositions and machinisms of love but one of the most important I feel is that of the Emotion of Love in which some of us have been able to identify in regards to falling in love. That warm loving feeling in the chest area and heart centre in which is a partial indicator that one is in love.\n\nAn emotion?\n\nThe Emotions that we feel in our Heart Centre and Emotion Area is potentially a stimuli that tells of the spiritual around us. We feel and experience emotions daily which lets us know that we are more than flesh and blood and that we potentially have a soul. It\u2019s one of the things that spiritualists can point towards in a scientific way that can lament upon learning in which you are going through in regards to Spiritual Education. The Science of Anatomy will potentially reveal in the future what spiritualist of today are letting know of in the communities that have emerged partially by way of the connection that the internet has created as well as connectedness of nature. Emotions I feel are part of Nature and that myriads of different informations out there letting know of other kinds of stimuli as well that could potentially be considered nature as well.\n\nWhat exactly is an emotion?\n\nWe experience emotions potentially in multiple kinds of ways but the main way that even the average person on this planet discerns the stimuli of emotions is that of feeling and some might point towards touch in which I feel could be considered but the utilization of the word feeling potentially points as well at times to the multi use that spirit employs in regards to certain words in which we use. Feeling almost laments upon another describer word that we use in which explains another kind of sense we have partially in regards to being able to sense emotions. We feel emotions and potentially touch emotions in a certain kinds of way. Visually how amazing would be if the Spirit World was looking upon Emotions similar to how they view physicals. It speaks of how the different perceptions pertaining to sense and what exactly we are. That there could be life within emotion itself is a possibility I have noticed through my own psychic research, Spiritual Communications and experiences.\n\nWhat kinds of emotions are there?\n\nImagine the composition and colour of physicals and other-dimensional beings impacted upon certain actions. That spiritually we could change colour based upon certain energy promotions in which even the energy promotion compositions themselves could potentially be affected upon the action themselves. Even moods could be impactful in regards to how we sense certain kinds of energies. The colour and composition of emotions being impacted at times in regards to the kinds of emotions we create and the thought that we are creating\n\nWhat exactly does it feel like?\n\nMany different kinds of stimuli. There is a lot of different kinds of feeling associated with kinds of senses that we are able to experience in regards to that of Love. From the breathlessness of fear to the high pitch illumination of Joy, the sorrows of despair to the mourning of sadness. To be able to describe some of these experiences without having to use the literal words in which it is trying to describe can be difficult especially since we use those very words to describe other kinds of things within life. We know it to exist by way of how we experience emotions and it is one of those senses in which has been described and understood in ways in which can seem kind of crazy that we don\u2019t fully know the metaphysics behind emotions especially in regards to how we have approached emotion in regards to the scientific communities. This speaks though of the glitch within the system especially in regards to some equating seemingly lack of proof that we have spirit when it partially lies within emotional research. Even describing some of the emotions that exist to regular folk sparks remembrance and understanding in ways in which let know that emotions exist.\n\nWhat exactly does it affect?\n\nWe as physical beings on this planet experience emotion to a certain degree as to acknowledge it\u2019s existence but what exactly is it? Analyze the emotions in which you feel daily and you may become more aware of the truth that exists behind those emotions. I have come to the believing factors that there is life within emotion through my own experiences. That the emotions that we create impact other kinds of spiritual entities behind the scenes in ways in which would make us pay more attention to our emotions. Affecting relationships and mentality, behaviour and personality upon emotional utilization. For some it might affect the setting and interaction in regards to ourselves. Again, seen within Near Death Experience tells of how in certain dimensional existence they can feel emotions to a heightened degree. The imaginings of being able to feel some of our emotions to such a degree especially the negative ones can give one a clue to the kinds of affect it can have on spiritual entities within radius of some of those emotions. For some realms the emotional climate of person might be weather patterns seen in the sky. It\u2019s makes one think about when we look up at the skies and the kind of weather systems we a re experiencing could be the mood atmospherics of the planet. Either way emotions affect many different things and it\u2019s not just in a visual sort of way but just as how we perceive emotions to be in an extra sensory sort way knocks upon the door that there are many different kinds of senses in which some spirits are perceiving emotions.\n\nIs there a difference between feeling emotion and creating it?\n\nYes, although just because we feel emotions throughout our life doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t creating those emotions as well by way of different spiritual mechanics. There is discernible difference though upon creating emotions and feeling emotions. Throughout our life we feel emotions naturally based upon certain situations in which can feel to be less of a willful endeavour in which behind the scenes spiritually it might very well be a willful endeavour. With that being said there is real emotion mechanisms that we can utilize to create emotions daily at will on our end. When you compare the stimuli of feeling emotions and creating emotions there is at least on the onset a difference. Imagine someone moving your leg in which in how it is experienced make you feel like your moving your own leg. Certain spiritual mechanisms being revealed to understand the difference between moving your own leg and someone moving your own leg. It might seem strange but understanding how Channeling works from the spirit can be equated to this example that spiritual entities are working through our own movements at times and that ability to be able to sense that. The same could be said about emotional implantation in regards to the emotions that we feel and being able to discern the difference between spiritual influencing and that of our own emotions as well as understanding the difference between feeling emotions and creating emotions. There are literal mechanisms of emotion in which one can use to create emotions. At times we haven\u2019t been able to fully feel these mechanisms. It\u2019s a tell of some of the lack of awareness in regards to our own spiritual emotional mechanisms. That we could go through life without fully being aware of a communication and sense that we could utilize daily that we have put on the back seat and labelled something that we feel at times instead of something that we can utilize partially by way of our interaction in regards to such a concept of emotions. It would be as if certain spirit channeled through our out loud voice and mind voice at times in which we labelled as something we are able to discern at times rather than be able to use daily as we often do in life. It\u2019s the subtle view in regards to emotions that laments upon something so as strange and obvious in regards to the fact that we are as passive as we have been in regards to our emotions. Partially has to do with understanding emotion and also speaks of the need to put more resources in regards to researching our own emotions.\n\nHow do you create Love?\n\nI learned from certain meditational techniques to be able to invoke the emotion of love where I then was able to understand the methods of emotional creation. As a psychic I am able to feel certain spiritual mechanisms that certain normal people might not be able to fully feel but regular people do know that emotion exists by way of feeling emotions daily. Being able to emulate the emotions you feel at times by way of emotional creation is a part of the learning. I learned from a spiritualist that explained these methods in what he called HCR that being Heart Chakra Radiance or Heart Radiance. White Light visualization techniques in which lent towards learning how to love. That would eventually lead towards the ability of being able to create one of the most wonderful emotions daily.\n\nHow does Love help you Spiritually?\n\nWhat if I was to tell you that we could create emotions through willful energy promotions and help Spirits behind the scenes in multiple kinds of capacities. That there is an actual emotion of love in which you can create that can be beneficial to your spiritual life through direct and indirect means. The radiance of loving energy creates bonds and connection in which furthers relationship in multiple regard and some of it might just be based off of the experience itself. Remember that some of the beings that utilize love might only be able to sense love through the feeling of emotion similar to how physical humans on this physical planet Earth mainly sense love. You can see the power within that and the emotion itself and the kind of impact that can have. There are spirits out there that base how it helps them simply by way of how it feels. The loving radiance can strengthen one karmically by way of how the light judges that action to be moral as well as the kind of energy projected. Raising karmic vibration as well as potentially others in the spirit world. Some of this is partially based of the parameters in how we want the love to affect us and some of which might be set up pre-incarnation and situated by Main Spirit Guides. In the spirit our Anatomy might very well be strengthened by way of loving daily. Think of weight lifting as a metaphor, that when we lift weights and exercise some of our anatomy is affected in certain ways in which can lend towards health. By way of Loving daily we increase and protect our spiritual Health. Think about being able to incarnate from our dimensional live into another existence and that within that existence we could pump iron in which would strengthen ourselves but at a pace where wouldn\u2019t need to lift weights as much as we would have in the pre-incarnate dimensions partially by way of the science of the dimensional existences. This is partially why Incarnation is miraculous and amazing and the metaphor in regards to weight lifting potentially can be said about loving daily while incarnate in which creates a lot positive karma and spiritual health by way of karmic science. We can utilize this to streamline our Karma progression by way of being incarnate and promoting Morality and other kinds of energy promotions.\n\nWhy do we gain Karma from Loving Daily?\n\nThere are many different kinds of layers to the Spirit Realm. In different dimensional existences there are different kinds of energy promotions in which literally strengthens our spiritual bodies by way of energy promotions. There is a baseline in regards to some of those Dimensional Existences in which points towards ethical alignment increasing Spiritual Frequency and vibration. Think of the Light seen in Near Death Experience Research as one of the Heavenly Existences that some of us traverse after death in which potentially exists around us while we live our life. There are many psychics that point towards Heaven being on Earth and one of the interpretations is a literal in that one of the overlaps around us is the Light and another speaks that we are of condensed light by way of physical dimensional science. The Light has been described in many ways from a Non-Living Higher Power to a Living Dimensional Setting with Personality but regardless we can utilize the Light to let know of certain kinds of Variables that can affect our karmic. This Karma might affect all manner of things in the Light. Think of the Light to also be a place in which is reported in the NDE Accounts in which within the Light there are different layers in which I have learned to call Plane Levels. These Plane Levels to some might look like different surfaces in which we can Traverse. Imagine being able to see multiple kinds of surfaces to the Earth where different Continents exist and potentially different kinds of peoples. For simplistic purposes imagine the light as a Cylinder beam of Light, in which there are many different levels within that Cylinder of Light. Our spiritual Anatomy potentially tethered to that Light by way of being Spiritual Entities of the Light. The God Spark is spoken of in multiple kinds of Spiritualist writings and regardless of how we were created there is multiple kinds of information in which point towards a large portion of All That Is being of the Light, some of which in a literal way. Karmic Vibration, Karmic Level and Karmic Frequency being reflected by the colour of our Light and other kinds in which points towards the Highest Point within the Light that we can ascend often called a Nexus Point. That Nexus Point reflecting our soul colour by way of karmic tethering to the plane level represented in the Highest Point within the Light that we can ascend. The Light Considers Loving to be a Moral Act and when we Love the Light allocates karma in regards to ourselves which increases our vibration, frequency and karma which also increase our access within the Light to Higher Plane levels and is reflected by our Karmic Colour.\n\nHow does our Karmic Colours Correspond with Karmic Levels?\n\nThink of those Plane Levels within the Light to be of different kinds of Coloured Light. I learned from one of my Spiritual Teachers certain kinds of Karmic Paradigms to exist within the Light. Different kinds of coloured levels of Light in which I adapted based off of Communication and subtle signs within the physical Itself. The physical Colour Spectrum being one of those tells in regards to which Karmic Colour corresponded with different plane level existences.\n\nAt a young age I was able to see dots of light in which I would find out are potentially interacting with me from the Spirit World. These dots of Light I was told and would confirm with psychic communication were potentially the Karmic Colours of Spiritual Entities in which I was able to see, it was one of the first psychcitivty that manifested. These Karmic Colours being representative in regards to the Highest Point within Light that they could ascend. Another subtle tell would that of the prism rainbow which speaks of the power of shapes. Which can reveal rainbows within light naturally in the physical. There is a spiritual metaphor regarding this pertaining to certain light existences afterlife. Entire surfaces of coloured Light located within certain Light Dimensional setting.\n\nWhat can you do being located at Higher Levels of Light?\n\nAs you increase in Frequency, Vibration and Karma you become more powerful as your God Spark and Soul grows and strengthens from Higher Light Access. A simplistic way of looking at certain kinds of Karmic levels is equating it to video game levels that as you promote Morality and Love you increase in levels in which your powers strengthen as you move to Higher levels. Larger utilization of Light in regards to Creation is another possibility of the benefits of moving upwards in frequency. Access to different kinds of cities of Light and information located above. Abilities Manifesting as you reach those levels of Light in ways in which can help you in Daily Spiritual Life. This lending towards the theory of God-Realization through morality promotion, love and other kinds of energy creation.\n\nGod-Realization Theory?\n\nDo note that this is a theory and I would still pursue the methods described in regards to Heart Radiance pertaining to Learning to Love regardless of what you believe in. Many understand the feelings of emotion and even the baseline feeling that you can create daily in regards to Love can be beneficial. There is an idea that the creator split himself to create many different kinds of spirits at lower karmic thresholds in which lends towards the God spark theories found in spiritualist writings on this planet. It also explains why there has not been more large scale miracles located on this planet and elsewhere at times in regards to the hypothesis that God potentially did not survive the split but there are also other theories as to why certain kinds of spiritual intervention has not yet happened similar to that of the Prime Directive which still lends to the idea that God has very much survived. There is a Theory that explains that certain kinds of Gods have yet to emerge to that original Karmic Level of the original Creator when he split up. Upon reaching those Kamric levels, certain spirits reaching to the karmic level of what some would equate to being Gods, would be able to emerge in the physical and harness the power obtained to promote larger acts of Morality like heal the sick on this planet in an instant and create large-scale manifestations of food and water for those in need. This idea that we could love daily while incarnate and streamline karmic progression where upon we eventually could be considered what some would consider to be Gods. Imagine passing on to the next place and through the act of love achieving God-Realization in certain dimensional existences.\n\nWhat is the Importance of Love?\n\nIt is described in many different sources and seen within many different writings. Experiences beyond in many different kinds of afterlife described where the feelings described let know of extra sensory ability extends beyond what we are able to discern at times while incarnate. Let knows of the importance of the creation of love is consistent so much so that it has seeped into our own society in it\u2019s own way as an underlying subconscious in which is partially based upon the spiritual understanding of just how important the endeavour of Love can be. It\u2019s more than just being able to traverse plane levels while incarnate and streamlining progression to that of Godship. The emotion encapsulates a secret that has been lost in some places in which at times certain spiritual communities have understood. The essence of what we are and one of the abilities to be able to express this.\n\nWhy does the Light consider Loving to be Moral?\n\nThe Light can discern Moral actions in more advanced ways than some of us discern morality to be. There is a gauge in regards to what we consider morality to be and what actions would be considered moral in which potentially stems from what the Light considered to be ethical. You can ask the average person as to whether they felt love to be a Moral action and the response will be heavily in favour of it being a Moral action for a reason. The moral Compass Gauges it to be that partially by way of societal perception in which is potentially based off of the Original Light ethical discernment. When coupled with the actual action and the feelings it can create, the connection and essence of what we are and used to be exists within the act of Loving. This creates a karmic gain upon the act itself. Our Societal Ethical Compass in what we understand to be Moral is a fairly good gauge in what the Light would consider to be Moral. There is a literal science in regards to how the Light understands Morality in which is Systemically Ancient.\n\nWhy does Society not fully understand these secrets of Love?\n\nThere is a reason why Love is considered to be secret to life. It\u2019s espoused in many different ways throughout spiritualist writings and Near Death Accounts that this is the case. Even in a mainstream way, Love is an underlying current that some are aware of and the concept exists in many kinds of forms in which societal awareness and understanding can grasp in certain ways. The key in regards to that awareness lies within falling in Love and what exactly that entails. Heart Song. Heart feelings in which leads someone to claim at times they are in Love is one of the specifics in which Heart Radiance exists within the context of what society understands love to be. The difficulty is that at times in regards to identifying that Love as a Real emotion in which can be utilized daily is that it has been turned into symbol where the knowledge of loving emotional radiance has been hidden. The great thing about it though is that it is a great positive to have such an interest in such a concept in which brings peripheral understanding and context in trying to explain what exactly Love is. It\u2019s not a concept as a psychic-medium that I would have to explain into detail as there already is perceptual understanding. There are many different kinds of Acts of Love but one of the ones I am espousing is in regards to literal emotional creation. It extend beyond though in many different capacities as I would find out.\n\nHow Exactly is literal Love going to Help me though?\n\nIt can create an environment around you spiritually where like minded spirits traverse to your process in which positively impact your life and lives of others. There are those in the spirit realm that benefit from love creation daily. It strengthens bonds and relationships and the invoking of Love and help in regards to the creation can be considered to be a moral endeavour. It helps create positive karma and can create higher light access in which can be utilize to create good. Potentially gaining access to new areas within the light and advanced abilities manifestation. It can lead towards greater emotional awareness and I feel it is a decent path towards becoming psychic and empathic should you want to pursue that endeavour. Spiritual Guideships know what you want as they can ask you spiritually in multiple kinds of ways without having to ask the you dimensional live self in a certain context. It strengthens certain setting and environment at times by way of utilizing love daily. The area around oneself benefits form utilizing love daily and can create positive effects as well as natural defense from certain negative spiritual entities. Literal boundaries set by way one emotionally presents oneself can lend towards the atmospherics of a process being impacted although there are spiritual teams that can help in regards to the negative of this understanding. It\u2019s not just helping you though it\u2019s also helping some of your spirit teams and guideship as well as those that you love towards.\n\nThe importance of love within the confines of spiritual development cannot be overstated. It is one of the keys to the secrets of life. Loving from your heart centre is very much a needed endeavour in today\u2019s world in which can help the Spirit World in many different kinds of ways. One of the key things that I want you to take away from the Methods listed in regards to Heart Radiance is to continue to try using the methods until you can discern Loving Emotions and understand that ability to Create Emotions.\n\nI learned methods on how to love from a teacher of mine called Avadar at a young age. I had been able to discern spiritual colours in which upon searching the Internet as to answers as to what exactly I was viewing, I found an answer in which struck a chord within myself that let know that the colours I was viewing was potentially thar Karmic Spiritual Colour of Spiritual Entities around myself. He developed certain Teaching earlier on in his life in the late eighties and early nineties in which has been refined today in how to love.\n\nI believe these teachings have been taught before through various metaphysical teachers in the past not only within the confines of this physical earth but also on other planets within different dimensions. Where the power of love manifested through the layers upon layers of life to uplift generations and inspire the awareness of those touched by the lover. Some of these teachings on our planet may have been lost to time over the years only to reemerge within certain timeframes but some of it might have survived and certainly have been relearned to reveal these teachings today.\n\nLove is powerful enough though to break through the collective consciousness in many different kinds ways, potentially the Spirit Realm giving us hints and clues as to one of the sacred things in life. Our experiences also give credence to some of the perceptions in which has emerged. The act of love itself has existed for near close to forever and relationships and bond created through those acts potentially remain to this day. It\u2019s augmented by the information coming out of the various psychic and spiritualist research happening today and in the past. Near Death Experience Research is one of those fields and just based off of scanning some of the Accounts I can say that there is let know of love and experiences of love within them in which points towards love being a secret to life in which in the Spirit Realm might not be as much of secret as it is on this Physical Earth Based Culture. Even within the Culture itself Love shines through into pop culture and societal perception in which is partially based off of the act of Falling in love. For some of those acts heart feelings manifest naturally and radiance amplified partially by way of the Spirit Around us. In which we can emulate in certain ways to be able to facilitate the emotion of Love daily.\n\nMy Teacher had labelled the Methods and Modes in which he came up with down here as Heart Chakra Radiance. HCR for short. I sometimes refer to it as Heart Radiance as I would discern a difference in regards to the Heart Chakra and that of the Emotion Centers within our Spiritual Bodies. Either way what we are ultimately referring to for the most part is that of love.\n\nThe point of these Heart Radiance Methods is to learn how to love but you could certainly apply the methods in regards to other types of emotions and energies. The Modes of heart radiance are there to eventually allow someone to be able to love at will without visualizations, meditations, and/or intimacy. Where you would be able to create the emotion of love at will through the action of wilful projection and creation of Love from the Heart Center and potentially from other areas as well. Where you would reach a point in your practice where you would be able to send love from the emotional body and centre at will and to then be able to use the actual emotion throughout everyday life.\n\nThe following are the methods of Heart Chakra Radiance(HCR). They were developed from my teacher Avadar early on in his life.\n\n\u201cMode 1: While breathing normally, visualize a sphere of white energy in your chest, or more specifically, in your Heart Chakra \u2013 the most important chakra for spiritual growth. Then, without holding your breath, visualize radiating white light out of this sphere in every direction at once. It is suggested that one first use this technique in light\n\n(alpha) meditation in order to become accustomed to it.\n\nMode 2: While visualizing Mode 1, program yourself simply through desire to radiate those aspects of spiritual white light \u2013 called Programmed White Light \u2013 that would help you grow in the fastest possible way. Once you start doing this, the improvement is immediate and requires no new concentrated effort; you improve as you use it.\n\nMode 3: This is a natural evolution from the previous modes. Through the application of mode 2 it is eventually realized when the will alone is sufficient to radiate: visualizing is no longer necessary because a certain degree of proficiency has been developed.\n\nMode 4: Because of the difficulty in visualizing this, this mode is not recommended until Mode 3 is performed fairly easily. With the Heart Chakra being the primary focus, radiate as you would from Mode 2 with all of the seven major chakras \u2013 all at the same time.\u201d",
