          "content": "I see a lot of post on reddit of people constantly asking \"how to be more spiritual \" \" how to be enlightened.\" Like it's some sort of achievement or destination. There are spiritual practices that help on this human journey but one cannot trancend being a Human while having a Human Experience. There is no thing to achieve this constant Belief that one must act a certain way because they are \"spiritual\" or follow more norms as if society didn't have enough already. \" you cant get angry you're spiritual\" \"you cant act that way\" this type of mentality causes more harm than good to you.  it's your own mind narrating a story making you believe you have to be a certain way or you're not spiritual. one collective consciousness experiencing itself thru different life forms, there is no manual, there is no set way. Don't let the mind box you in & fill you with spiritual  labels and behaviors.",
