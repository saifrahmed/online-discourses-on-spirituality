Now came to the point i can have it if i want without exterior stimulus(just with a thought , not strong as with music though). It  is intensity and frequency increased over time but strongest one came around 20 years ago. It went to the point something inside my head literally hit the top, i felt it phisically. I afraid and closed the music. It was always a big mystery for me. I'm skeptic about it's nature. Is it just the brain's dopamine release or something related to spirit. I was more on the brain's product camp several years ago as an atheist at that time. But after having many interesting mystic experience for all these years that i can't explain and after researching NDE and SDE phenomenon closely I am convinced that there is something more. I feel this chills like the star of earendil that i use on a difficult life path. Still don't know what i can do more for a spiritual journey also not so sure about if we have to do anything. It looks like just being kind and loving is the right way still so hard to do in this world though. ",

Those moments, my visions were extremely more vivid plus my time outside of my body were much more longer than the moments I usually astral projected or did out of body experiences without absorbing the sun's energy.\n\nThis helped me come to the conclusion that the only reason my experiences were much more heightened than usual is because of my conscious absorbtion of the sun's heat with my spiritual chills.\n\nAstral body, spirit, emotional body, whatever you want to call it, if you wish to do the same, your spiritual chills are key and you can learn how to do this too with [the tutorial #14 in here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/s/76VnkGRclZ).",

Do you even know you have the power.\n\nYou are a powerful being, you have all the power and all the energy to make all your dreams come through. The key is just getting your vibration correct. How?\n\nWhen you emit a frequency(through your thoughts, states of mind, point of views or emotions), the exact same frequency is drawn to you. The entire universe works together to mimic that frequency and bring it towards you in events, situations or people.\n\nMore importantly, bringing up your spiritual energy while doing that allows your frequency to travel virtually in three dimensions all throughout the universe, in all directions simultaneously with the same intensity.\n\nAnd this can even be picked up all over the globe by other people.\n\nThis spiritual energy can be most easily felt within us through self-induced goosebumps from positive events/stimuli.\n\nThis energy has been researched and documented under many names Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Intent, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, The Tingles, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) talking about the technique to use your spiritual energy to consciously send out something you want to attract back in your life.\n\nP.S.

With whats happening in Palestine, my friends and family have been extremely distraught and we took this as an opportunity to instead show respect for the  indigenous natives that lived here in America long before. \n\nWe were flecting on the horrors that many tribes faced on Thanksgiving and how it has become a commercial holiday for everyone to celebrate. We talked about how inconsiderate it is for us, who are currently watching a genocide unfold to not empathize and remember the natives who died on this very day.\n\nSo my cousin and I are discussing all this in the kitchen post-dinner. Everyone in my family is very spiritual. We go on to say that on this day we should honor and remember these natives in the Islamic way we know how, its called Surah Fatiha- a prayer from the Quran known as the \u201cOpening\u201d.\n (Al-Fatiha is considered a comprehensive summary of the Quranic message and serves as a foundation for the believer\u2019s connection with Allah(God) in their daily prayers. It holds deep spiritual and symbolic importance in Islamic worship and is recited in every unit of the Muslim prayer.)\n\nWe both bow our heads and read this prayer to our selves followed by a prayer to the natives. We both open our eyes and notice a major shift in energy. My cousin mentioned she felt deep sadness and I was left with the feeling of a very heavy heart. My sister comes up stairs and immediately notices soemthings going on and shes said, \u201c whoa it feels heavy in here\u201d. I go on to tell her what wemve been discussing and I tell her \u201cthe truth is we\u2019re living on stolen land\u201d and IMMEDIATELY the lights completely fuse in the house and the house goes dark. The ONLY time my lights fuse is when there are multiple things running. This wasnt the case that night. Obviously we all freaked out for a second and I neverously laughed it off while running down the stairs. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. \n\nI truly feel that all the natives wanted is to be remembered and acknowledged on this day and not selfishly making this about ourselves and to be honest gluttony, with the amount of food we make. \nThat is what I took from that. Who knows how many graves we live on in America? How many battles have taken place on the land we have our houses built on. All of that energy residing underneath us..\n\nAll I know is, this is a tradition I will now do forever",

I experienced with my spiritual energy, my spiritual chills and eventually found a way to drag in the sun's heat with the conscious activation of my spiritual chills.\n\nWhat I experienced after was clear to me how much there was a difference between what I was doing before in comparisons with what I learned to do with my spiritual chills.\n\nI felt that everywhere that I was depositing the sun's heat, with my spiritual chills in my body for the whole meditation session, would make that location feel like a gentle burn that was not hot but in fact ice cold. \n\nThis lasted hours after my meditation session and that's when I realized I just had figured a way to consciously abosrb energy from outside sources. \n\nThis led to other confirmations from the other side too which I will definitely share later on.\n\nIf you're interested in learning what technique I used exactly you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/s/oX4JKr3Bot).",

Suicide is a theme during these infrequent occasions and while I'm not remotely suicidal outside of these episodes, in those moments I contemplate it seriously (not as an immediate action, but more as a legitimate option at some undefined point in the future). \n\nHowever several times now, in the midst of a dark spiral of hopelessness, I have felt the most incredible love and comfort envelop me, putting an immediate stop to the despair. Like every cell in my body is infused with some essence of love. It happens immediately, like flipping a switch. It's not like my thoughts gradually get less dark and I work my way slowly out of the pit; I am suddenly lifted out and thereafter incapable of feeling bad even if I try. I can think the same thoughts that were, moments previously, like daggers to my soul but they have no effect. I am suddenly within an impenetrable bubble of love. It's happened 3 or 4 times. It doesn't happen every time I'm sad or spiraling, but comes only in my very darkest of moments. \n\nAnyway I want to know if this remarkable energy is coming from God, a guardian angel, a departed loved one or, in my most hopeful of fantasies, a soul mate whom I've yet to meet but am connected to in another plane.",

          "content": "Hey, guys. I've only been here a short time, but this group has been very helpful in explaining many of my questions about spiritual chills. So it's time to also pass some wisdom back.\n\n**Why you should read this post ?**\n\nI knew about spiritual chills all my life but did not know what was it. I found holotropic breathing about half a year ago and now that I have learned what spiritual chill is these 2 pieces of information fit together like nothing else for me.\n\n**Back story:**\n\nFormer Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic and Slovakia was in the 50s and 60s a pioneer in research on psychedelics and psychotronics in the then Soviet sphere of influence. The most famous figure of this period and, according to James Fadiman, one of the first people in the world to research and study LSD was **Prof. Stanislav Grof**. In an interview I saw with him, they asked him. Why did you invent holotropic breathing? And he answered: Well, the LSD experiments were banned, we ran out of LSD, but people wanted to continue the therapy, so we started breathing.\n\n**What is Holotropic breathwork?**\n\nHolotropic breathwork is a breathing technique where you use breathing, meditation, music and darkness to induce a change of consciousness. You can find more about it in his book: Holotropic Breathwork: A New Approach to Self-Exploration and Therapy, or various other sources.\n\n**Why does it fit together with spiritual chills?**\n\nWhen I personally do this technique it gives me spiritual chills like nothing else. You can feel a strong shiver circling in your body and concentrating in my case in my hands and core. After comparing it to summoning spiritual chills through out the meditation this is a truly next level for me.\n\nSo I hope this kind of info will be helpful to anyone and have a great time.\n\n&#x200B;",

          "content": "Hi everyone. I'm not sure that what I'm experiencing is considered spiritual chills, but thought I'd share to see if anyone else has experienced what I call \"pulsing crown\".\n\nWhen I'm doing any spiritual work,  realize a syncronicity, journaling or practicing divination I get a warm soft pulsing at my crown. It's actually doing it now, so I can say it also feels slightly tingly, but very, very lightly. The pulsing sensation is stronger.\n\nThis sensatation started after, what I've accepted to be, my first interaction with a spirit. That's been about three years ago. I feel it's somehow confirmation? Of what, I'm not sure. Perhaps my guardian angel, Sam, directing my attention?  As I typed Sam it did it again, lol. (I thanked her.) Maybe she's just encouraging me to keep moving foward on my path?\n\nTo be more specific it feels as if I put a wreath of warm flowers on my head and where the wreath is touching my head is exactly where I feel the warm pulsing.  Does anyone share the same experience or have any thoughts. I'd live to hear what you think. Sorry if I went a bit long. My husband says I tend to ramble. Thanks for your time \ud83d\ude4f",

          "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI found a great way to induce spiritual chills during meditation. \n\nFirst, get into your usual meditation position. \n\nSecond, keep your focus/ attention into your heart. Let your thoughts come and go freely, without restraint. Don't pay them any heed/ mental energies, only the heart. For the mind is the talkative fork-tongued fool, rambling on every moment during the day (especially during meditation), speaking more ill than well. Yet the heart is the silent master, far wiser than your mind. (This is an understatement, for it is the difference between hell and heaven.) It is the portal to God/ Your Higher Self. It is the seat of life, the throne room/ temple of God. \"The Kingdom of God is Within You\" is the key phrase in **Luke 17:21.** \n\nListen to the Silent Master (God), that does not need words to speak to you, with complete surrender. Once opened and while listening to your heart deeply, allow your body to become filled with His Infinite Divine Love, that is His Hallmark, pouring out of your heart in waves like a gentle fountain. (Spiritual chill overload.)\n\n Once felt, it changes your life irreversably. It is a feeling so sweet, so beautiful, undescribable. It is the strongest force in known existence, Infinite Divine Love (Unconditional Love). It is the power to end all wars. To end all illusions of duality. Once felt, you instantly forget all envy, hatred, fear, doubt, shame and pain you've been dealing with, no matter how deep-rooted. \n\nThis feeling, transforms even the most fearful coward into the most courageous of lions. It makes the most hardened of warriors weep like little infants. It makes the suicidal overflow with zest. The hopeless filled with unwavering faith. It washes away all pain, all suffering, all vileness. It makes the devil flee from you in terror. All in just one moment, where time seems crystalized into inertia.\n\nOverflow with this feeling of Infinite Divine Love and send it 'out' into the morphogenic field, so all may receive His Grace, this feeling of Infinite Divine Love that transforms worlds.\n\nLet's transform ours, by merely generating those 'spiritual chills' from our hearts.",

I hold back my chills as long as I can before the feeling overtakes me and I just can\u2019t hold it back anymore. I usually do this by eliminating all my primers (primers = moments in time that trigger chills). The reason I do this is to savor my chills and hopefully make them stronger. But for awhile now my chills didn\u2019t feel as pure as they once were. That is until I tried another method of going hungry. By allowing my primers to release my chills but suppressing my chills so that I don\u2019t get the full feeling I noticed that they became much more potent and pure overtime. I think this is because when we feel chills there is a chemical that is released in the body that binds to receptors in the body. And by suppressing the chills this \u201cbinder\u201d floods the body. Then when we want to feel chills are bodies are 50x more primed to do so and we get a much more potent and pure feeling. It took me about 2 days of doing this before I started to notice my chills were starting to get really pure. Then at day three I broke through and it felt like an atomic bomb went off inside me. If anybody can attempt this, I\u2019m really interested in what you find. Please let me know or comment. ",

          "content": "During meditation, while bringing up spiritual chills, you can witness these glowing spheres of energy that we all either send out or attract daily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are actually two types of these orbs. The first are glowing/transparent orbs that are made of energy specifically related to an energy/emotion/vibration/frequency that is either being sent out from you or drawn to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second type that you can also come in contact with are made of non-physical being/spirit or being used as a vehicle for a consciousness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese Orbs can and have been spotted in photos/videos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what I researched and learned after having experienced multiple contacts with them. Most of those contacts happened while I was circulating my spiritual energy. I'd even go as far as to say that ever since I started circulating this spiritual energy is when I started noticing them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA simple definition for spiritual energy is that blissful wave that can most easily be felt/recognized as present while you get goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring one of my meditation sessions, As I was sweeping my whole body up then down with this energy while feeling intense gratitude, I saw from my half closed eyes, a golden orb the size of a grapefruit approach me and enter my body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was one of the first times I experienced those orbs in 2013. I still do to this day and I know this was successful thanks to the circulation of that blissful wave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis energy has been researched and documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearning how to do this is really simple.\n\nHere are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) that will introduce you to this energy, help you feel it on command, witness these orbs and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on [r/spiritualchills](http://r/spiritualchills) where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",

If you take time to notice you will find that your positive chills have an accompanying sort of wave underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot).\u00a0\n\n\nAfter researching what that specific current underneath the skin is, I came across a sort of\u00a0energy\u00a0we have that is tied to our spirit.\u00a0It flows through the body via channels or meridians that connect all parts of the body and has been a well known fact in the east for thousands of years.\n\n\nThis energy can be learned to be activated as you please without any outside stimuli, just the simple intention of experiencing it. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.\n\n\nWhy is this important? Too many sources point us to outside substances to manage stress, as if the human body wasn't designed to be able to rely on itself for its own internal problems.\n\n\nConsider that, if you can truly induce that good occurrence at will, you can definitely use it to counteract feelings of stress.\n\n\n\nThis energy has been researched and documented\u00a0under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\n\nHere are [three\u00a0written tutorials](https://reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/s/cctuFCCPmQ)\u00a0that go more in depth about how you can allow it to be felt everywhere in your body, If you are interested in taking control of this and feel euphoric on-demand.\n\n\nP.S.

It gave me pretty good insight into vibrations, energy, and even the law of attraction. The scientific explanations are excellent; way more interesting than most of the boring quantum science I've tried reading.\n\nSo I wanted to ask, what's the best way for manifestation that you've come across? Is it subliminal programming? Or feeling grateful for the future? Or simply a prayer, maybe at 4:00AM everyday? \nAlso, going on a bit of a tangent here, but yes, I'd like to hear experiences about people who started praying really early everyday. How did that affect you?",

          "content": "\n\nKnowing this, the key becomes getting your vibration correct. \n\nHow? By consciously bringing up your spiritual energy.\n\nThis spiritual energy can be most easily felt within us through self-induced goosebumps from positive events/stimuli. Upon gaining full control of this occurence, you can learn how to seperate the physical reaction of goosebumps from that euphoric wave that is also present when you get chills.\n\nThis then allows you to be able to summon this energy on demand, all over your body and manipulate its duration.\n\nSince this energy is already subtely active in everyone of us, to speed up manifestations, what's important is to know which location is necessary to focus it and how to feel it there.\n\nIn the average unaware person who's passive in their life, it's active in areas where negative emotions like fear, stressed, anxious, hopelessness and etc. comes up.\n\nConsciously bringing up your spiritual energy allows your vibration to travel virtually in three dimensions all throughout the universe, in all directions simultaneously with the same intensity.\n\nAnd this can even be picked up all over the globe by other people.\n\nAnd for those of you who always wonder about the difference between spirituality and science, I would suggest to consider that there really is no difference. \n\nSpirituality is simply science which hasn't been proven yet.\n\nThings that you classify as spiritual in nature are really in effect science. But science hasn't figured out a way to explain it yet. And as we learn more and more about subatomic, Physics subatomic, quantum physics, things that were in the past considered spiritual that now actually have a real scientific base, these will be proven and released to the public, hopefully.\n\nThe bottom line here is you have to have the cognition of how powerful you can be and how much of a creator you are.\n\nThis spiritual energy has been researched and documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, on-demand quickening Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\nHere's a short [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/u82qqfxu_p4) talking about why some of us automatically and primarily feel it in certain parts of our body, what type of properties these areas have with this energy like manifestation and how to bring it up in any body parts.\n\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on r/spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",

          "author": "iWalkie",
          "content": "I wanted to share a meditation technique I've developed that channels pure energy through the body. This is a process that clears the energy field within while cleansing anything negative within the system. Completely safe process as the receiver is at a relaxed meditative state. It's a process I've performed 26 times with a 100% success rate, and I'm excited to share it with this community.\n\nThe Process: This meditation involves two people and requires only a pair of headphones and quartz crystals. The energy starts from the hands, progresses to the spine, and culminates at the pineal gland. Below is a description of the entire meditation process\n\n(Note: Take your time with each movement. Don't rush it and allow the receiver to think thoroughly and receive the energy without the feeling of being rushed. This is their journey. Go along with them in their journey at their pace)\n\n1. the receiver of energy must sit comfortably facing you eyes closed during the entire meditation with quartz crystals in their hands, headphones on listening to Hz music (frequency depends on what the receiver is trying to achieve), then the receiver must picture a big black box it's very important to put everything negative in that big black box then close it for good (give them around 5+ minutes depending how much trauma they have)  \nHz Frequency Music:  \nAny search on Youtube or Spotify will do but here are some of my favorites  \n432 + 528 Hz [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23vdHx5X\\_D4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23vdHx5X_D4)  \nNikola Tesla's 3 6 9 Code Music [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83LsHzsmPeU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83LsHzsmPeU)  \n963 Hz [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wmuqOdmqAc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wmuqOdmqAc)  \nNative American Flute Music [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST56ATKfgfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST56ATKfgfs)\n2. the healer and the receiver must lock hands and go back and forth like a seasaw of energy with the quartz crystals in between the hands. After going back and forth the healer pushes all the energy into the receiver holding for around 5 seconds then the energy travels up to the receivers spine (do this 10 rep motion around 5 times)\n3. the healer goes behind the receiver and does a spiral design with their index finger on the receivers back. Do this around 6 times or so. The goal of this is for the receiver to gather energy at the center of the spine so the center of the spine should be the center of the spiral\n4. the healer directs the energy built up in the spine to the back of the head by using their index finger from the spine to the back of the head. Do this around 6 times\n5. the healer directs the energy with their index finger from the back of the head to the pineal gland. do this around 6 times\n6. the healer using their thumb on the receivers pineal gland (not pushing hard physically) but pushing a lot of energy into the receiver. This is one of the most important steps because it destroys all the negativity in the receivers life. So push all the energy into the pineal gland around 4 or 5 times holding it around 10 sec each time\n7. Give the receiver a little bit of time to enjoy their vision. Send positive energy to them during the vision\n\nDuring the process the receiver of energy will go under a trance and have a vision of what the soul wants to show the receiver. Think of it as a mini dream or vision. At the bottom of this post I will paste sessions I've done in the past and what people have experienced\n\nBenefits: Anxiety, depression, anger, trauma are all reduced or gone for good. Brain fog dissipates and the mind expands. Skin health is improved. Pain is reduced or eliminated. Senses are improved mostly smell and taste. Strength, agility and balance are improved. Some participants are able to feel energy describing it as feeling hot, cold or like gravity. They can channel that energy to reduce pain within their body after the session. The receiver will feel very good after the meditation and things will improve on a daily basis after the meditation\n\nWhy This Works: I believe this is related to string theory as everything in our universe is created by vibrations. Nikola Tesla stated \"If you want to learn the secrets of the universe think in terms of energy, frequency, vibrations.\" It's the energy between two people, frequency of Hz music grounds the user, vibrations are absorbed by the quartz crystals which allows the pure energy to flow through the receiver of energy. As a baby we are born with pureness and we do not have depression, anxiety, anger, trauma. All of this is obtained over time and this process is essentially a cleansing. It removes all the built up clutter over the years. Therapy and pills are only temporary solutions this is an actual cleansing\n\nMeditation Visions:\n\nSession 1 - I went under pretty quickly. I saw my deceased mother right away. She took my hands and told me that she was really proud of me and was always there with me. I wanted to go home with her but she said that I had to stay here and take care of my grandchildren\n\nSession 2 - I went to a beautiful field that was filled with dandelions. The kind that you blow and the seeds fly away. In front of me was this couple dancing. The two moved as one in perfect synergy. I couldn't see their faces but the woman was wearing a beautiful yellow dress and the man was dressed in a black tuxedo. From the dancing you could tell they were soul mates. The weather was warm with a nice breeze. I blew my dandelion into the sky and all the seeds flew away. I picked one and just watched the seed floating and spinning. Going further and further away. The next thing I saw was my life on a picture reel like in the old movies. Each frame was playing and as the frame played blue, green, yellow, red then purple, purple, purple, blue, green yellow red. Then purple, blue appeared as well. My life kept going frame by frame and color by color\n\nSession 3 - Saw a big purple Aura and the big black box flew away. I felt great afterwards\n\nSession 4 - I saw a waterfall and there was a branch with a red bird sitting on it. At one point I saw flashes of white\n\nSession 5 - I saw water with raindrops falling into it. Further on there were dandelions with seeds in them and I was just watching them move around then at the end there was a lot of purple. Also a little bit of green and yellow\n\nSession 6 - A waterfall pouring down at the end of a dam. The waterfall erupted into roaring water for a second then turned into a beach with soft waves. I was standing on the beach kissing my girlfriend\n\nSession 7 - There were 3 houses within a prism. Rectangle and triangle shaped houses. the two parents were fighting then one went away. There was another house added. Then things just improved after that\n\nSession 8 - I saw my boyfriend and I saw purity and the color white. My friend was there also saying hi to me and watching me from heaven\n\nSession 9 - It began with Castiel from Supernatural in the nothingness with black around him. Then it was just me. I was floating around in the air. then I went to the black box and everything was black. The black box melted within the background. The box wood ingrained with a lighter black. It was closed with a lid on it. I jumped to stir of echoes with Kevin bacon in the theatre. I was viewing from the back but nothing was on the theatre screen. Then it changed. I could see a lot of swirls that came into view. the swirls continue out more and more. Getting further and further away. The black box appeared again but the lid was off of it this time. There wasn't anything materialistic inside of it. There was something in there that was white and it was no physical item. Something was in there but I couldn't see it. It was tilted so it was just out of my view. The black box faded in the last stage. I saw flashes then the black box disappeared\n\nSession 10 - It felt like I went into a gate opening. It was like a relieving breath of fresh air. I felt like I was where I needed to be. I was walking through doors. It felt very serene and beautiful. A place that doesn't exist but I wish it did. It felt animated like really good animation. Real life animation\n\nSession 11 - Going in I saw a spiral. It was fun then it switched directions. It was dark but it was a fun dark like Nightmare before Christmas. Nothing too detailed very vague. The swirls were appearing in the tunnel. I felt welcomed in like I was coming into my own house. Everything was brief. Not slow motion at all. I went into Nightmare before Christmas. It was simplified but I enjoyed it. Something in my head said don't expect more than what's available to you. I was there but I didn't see any characters. It was like I was Tim Burton creating it. Even though the session was only 20 minutes it felt over an hour. As I walked in I felt like I was in control. Dark is my happy place so I felt at home. There wasn't color it was black, white, gray. It's like a puzzle figuring what happened. the Nightmare before Christmas world opened up and allowed me to do what I wanted but I had to do it now as I felt like I didn't have a lot of time. I got where I wanted to be but I felt like I shouldn't waste time. I needed to do what I needed to do\n\nSession 12 - I started putting stuff in the black box then god took the box and threw out the box. It felt like I released a lot mentally after the session was over\n\nSession 13 - I created the big black box and started putting all my past trauma, depression etc. within it. The box started going further and further away. Smaller and smaller it got. The lid was shut then a guy appeared in a long white robe and long white beard wielding a pitchfork. The box opened and he started stabbing everything that was in the box tossing everything out of the box with the pitchfork. Everything in the box drifted away into the sky further and further away. He walked around and came in front of me. He tried to stab me with the pitchfork 3 times but it doesn't phase me at all nor was I afraid of it. After a while he turned around and walked away from me. He just gave up trying to hurt me\n\nSession 14 - The whole meditation process was great. I actually did it twice. I had to breathe in and out slowly to stay at peace. Everything that was kept deep inside was put in an empty box so all the good thoughts can come and stay for good. When the first one was done, I felt purity; but the second one I felt happiness and warmth. All of the trauma I experienced vanished to a box and then it was locked up; making sure that the bad box was to never be opened anymore. Meditation is important in life; just like loving one another because life is too short to be living with bad thoughts and regrets. There's a song lyric I listen to and the lyric goes: \"These secrets that you keep, they're lies that make you weak.\" My experience with this meditation process made me experience that there's more to life to explore, live with zero regrets. Anyone can learn the process. A lot of weight was lifted off the mind. Good vibes come through to get rid of the bad. My experience overall was 20 out of 10\n\nI'm eager to hear your thoughts, experiences, and any insights you may have on this technique or similar practices.

Look at everything within the big picture instead of focusing on the smaller picture. Unite and combine our knowledge together so we may create a better tomorrow. Realize that Science and Spirituality are two sides of the same coin and if we don't acknowledge both we will never find the answers we seek. This is essentially combining both and the potential is endless. I've tried to submit this data for research within a lab setting but I haven't gotten a reply. I've also tried offering this as a donation service but unfortunately there are a lot of scams in this area and people don't normally trust this type of stuff. So essentially I'm so confident in these results that I'm willing to have it tested within a lab and I even offer the service for free relying on the kindness of my clients. I hope you all will help me let the world know there is an alternative way for mental health and I hope to heal a lot of minds in the future. Would also be great to read visions people have during the process if you attempt it.",

          "content": "I hesitate to share this with anyone in my life, because I know how this can appear very delusional to those in a more 3D existence.\n\nSo all my life I have gotten spiritual chills related to music, particularly triggered by lyrics. It makes me feel an intense connection to the creators of the songs. It's actually a very small specific group of individuals that I feel connected to. To the point where I feel like could they be part of my soul tribe?\n\nIt's like I can see through their song, I can pinpoint why they made it, what the lyrics were inspired by.. their feelings. When I watch their interviews later I get many confirmations of my suspicions, and when I watch them I feel a sense of 'home'. I sometimes receive similar ideas to them, in the following months they release music or visuals that were what I had visions of before.\n\nI can give a tiny example,\n\n\\-I made a desktop collage, One part was a picture of Bjork, I put a geode over her heart. She released  an album about 6 months later, Vulnicura, about healing heart wounds, with her bent over a rock and her chest cut open.\n\nIt's like I'm a container for this specific creative energy that flows to these musicians, but in my real life I am not actually doing anything related to music.. yet. I generally believe that ideas are seeded out from the universe to a group of people who can execute them, and then it germinates to whoever picks up the call, or does it first etc. \n\nI used to use the spiritual chills feeling to channel artwork out of the repetition of songs, but it felt like an extra step, like taking something multi-dimensional and flattening it. I often see entire music videos or get dance movements to the songs. I receive lyrics. I get very energised off music.\n\nMusic saved my life when I was going through very intense traumas as a child, so I wonder if in a way I was trauma bonded? \n\nIt's just that the synchronicities of this are so strong. I used to revere these musicians too, but I no longer do. I still admire them but I think celebrity worship is kind of a handing of your power over. I see them as the same level, just people.\n\nI've been questioning my career for a while. I was a visual artist taking commissions, but I had to stop, it was too commercial and too flat and did not set my soul on fire. In my heart I really want to create music, dance, video, lyrics but I'm kind of afraid of the industry... Even though part of me knows that would be my highest timeline.\n\nI have a desire to save others through music the way it saved me.\n\nI don't know where I'm going with this. I guess I'm seeking permission to leap into my dreams. What started this all was the spiritual chills. Any one else relate to this?",

Eventually, you can learn how to bring up this wave of euphoric energy without the physical reaction of goosebumps, feel it over your whole body and increase its duration.\n\nIt has been researched and documented under many names like Euphoria, Tension, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Tummo, Orgone, Kriyas, Mana, Od, Bio-electricity, Life force, Pit\u012b, Frisson, The Secret Fire, Vril, Odic force, Voluntary Piloerection, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, ASMR, Nen, Spiritual Energy, The Force, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.\n\nIf you are interested in taking control of this and feel euphoric on-demand, here's a [tutorial Youtube video](https://youtu.be/EnypMr-JXKk) explaining how you can also activate your spirits power.\n\nP.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on and those are exactly the people you can find on r/Spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on how-to induce it to counteract stress or feel euphoria on-demand.",

A couple months ago I had gone to a crystal pop up stand and had the urge to buy a rose quarts and a selenite for her to place at her gravestone. (I did some research to make sure they were okay to be placed). I\u2019ve never tried going to the cemetery by myself because it\u2019s always been hard on me going since she passed so it wasn\u2019t until about a week ago on Saturday that I had the feeling that I really needed to go see her. Like if something was pushing me to go see her and leave the crystals. When I left them I felt a wave of cold chills and broke down crying, but when I left home I was fine. It wasn\u2019t until that following Wednesday and the next that I would go to visit my grandpa at his house he shared with her that I started feeling constant chills. They stay constant while I sit in the living room or while we eat dinner at there and even up until I leave. They didn\u2019t stop until I was at home asleep. Since it\u2019s happened these two times I\u2019ve gone over with the same thing happening now I want to know what is going on? How do I understand what\u2019s going on?",

          "content": "I posted about what I've been calling 'energy rushes', 'cold shower on the inside' or 'braingasms' for decades in a different subreddit and a kind soul directed me to this sub. I'm so excited to have found a sub with others who experience this!! \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\n\nI've been experiencing this for 15-20 years at least, probably much longer, bit I didn't attach much meaning to it before I became spiritual. Since becoming spiritual some 15 years ago I have used it to communicate with source / my higher self / God / Christ / my guides / the souls of those who have passed (whom I help move on btw) and much more for at least 15 years. (Don't worry I always make sure to protect myself). I connected with my daughter's soul as wellfor many years before I had her. She was making it very clear she wanted to be born to me \ud83d\ude05\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffd\n\nSo I can bring it on consciously, by simply asking to connect to something specific. I'll just think or ask out loud \"are you there?\" and woooosh in comes the rush. I can then ask yes or no questions and I'll get more rushes if the answer is affirmative, nothing if it's negative or if they don't want to answer (they won't reply to questions about my love life or if I ask for overly specific directions for my life \ud83d\ude05). \n\nI also get it in response to beautiful music, being truly present in nature or when thinking inspired thoughts or reading or hearing messages that are somehow of importance to me on a spiritual level. \n\nI typically get it many times a day, since I can control when I want to connect there's not really much of a limit to it. \n\nI can close myself off to it when I don't want to feel it / connect to it. \n\nAnyway without being able to truly be sure of what I'm connecting to I sometimes had doubts and closed myself off to it for longer periods. I noticed that life typically feels a lot lighter and I feel much more supported when I allow it to happen though. \n\nTo me it typically enters through my crown and dependable on the strength it will either just stay in my crown area, but usually it will travel down my spine and into most if not all of my body. \n \nI'm so curious to hear about everyone's experiences and interpretations.\nWhat do you think it is? Can you control it? How has it affected your life?\nI learnt from it that one if the ways I can be of service is to help souls cross over / create a better afterlife for themselves. The rushes of gratitude I get when I've helped them are wonderful \u263a\ufe0f",

          "content": "I was asked to streamline my last three posts. Here is the edit.\n\nPart 4- Love\n\nWhat is love? Everyone loves something or someone. One could love their parents, their children, one could love their job or car, pets or shopping. One could love only their Self. The point here being there are as many different types of love as there are people on the planet. To be more precise there are infinite forms to the infinite power of love and each one unique. \n\nLove can be understood intellectually through identifiers such as selflessness, many define this through acts of charitable giving and the like, the words of Jesus from the Christian Bible come to mind, \u2018Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\u2019 Spreading love can be such a simple matter and it costs nothing of the individual to give. \n\nImagine a gas station clerk who has to deal with angry customers all day long. Offering a smile can brighten their day and in turn they pass that light onto others, those in turn pass it along indefinitely. That simple smile has the potential to change the course of an entire life. That may seem like a grandiose statement, however I can attest to its accuracy firsthand. It\u2019s always better to deal with someone when they\u2019re in a good mood. Spreading love can be thought of as spreading positivity. \n\nSo what is love, exactly? Written of previously, Love is Light and Light is creation. One could accurately describe love being made of photons, photons have no mass and act as the force carrier for electromagnetism. This may be of significant importance to those experiencing Spiritual Chills, as we physically react to electromagnetic fields. \n\nWhen one spreads positivity, that light vividly illuminates the darkness in another, providing a positive catalyst. When the catalyst is examined and understood, it becomes reconciled and balanced in the individual, and ultimately results in an elevated level of understanding. Not so coincidentally, the green ray, or the heart chakra is that of love. It should be concretely pointed out that spreading love is the highest duty and honor, and as with everything else there exists a balance. Love does not demand martyrdom, and this is where Wisdom comes into the equation. \n\nPart 5- The Cost of Wisdom \n\nWhat is Wisdom? Is it the culmination of knowledge through the annals of time? The ability to make sound choices? The ability to discern right from wrong? Perhaps it is insight? It is another question that is simple in the asking, yet requires a significant amount of thought. Wisdom is all of the above and more, it can not be given, it must be actively sought after and obtained by the individual. Wisdom must be earned through experience, and there is a price to be paid for such experience. That cost is innocence, when that innocence is lost one sheds ignorance. Often the cost is painful as it goes against the misconceptions that have been ingrained within the individual since birth. To state that the cost is worth the pain would be a massive understatement. Paying that price soon becomes the primary method of discernment as one begins to question everything and Wisdom paves the way for understanding. Let me iterate, there is nothing in this world that can not be loved. There is nothing in this world that can not be understood. \n\nPart 6- The Twin Pillars of Love and Wisdom\n\nIt is my current understanding that the entire point of existence here in this time/space is to learn how to love unconditionally. Loving one who loves you in return is easy, loving those who hate you is a much taller task.\nI had the hardest time seeking the understanding of how I could love those who are intentionally bent on destruction. One answer I came across was empathy. In the context of empathy, I consider the lack-of-love that led to the mindset of destruction. In what type of environment were these people raised that  caused such hatred they would focus on such destruction? \n\nAnother answer I came to is gratefulness. I can be thankful for the example of how not to act. Their negative actions helps to distill light from their darkness. To this point, understanding that darkness is critical to the mechanics of this process. The darkness serves the Light. The negative serves to elevate the positive. It is a cycle that continues ad infinitum. Going further and perhaps a bit more aggressively, the darkness is fodder for the Light.\n\nAttaining the ability to love allows one to apply wisdom. In every interaction, I try to ask myself \u201cHow can I be the best Human possible? How can I spread as much light and love as possible?\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s making people laugh, other times it\u2019s as simple as listening. Exercising free will in a manner that spreads love is Wisdom. With that in mind, all that is left is application in daily life. \n\nA new perspective is born combining love and wisdom into the existing consciousness. Viewing a situation from both sides of the equation allows for more complete observations, and with it comes a sense of peace. This has allowed me to cast off many major, would be distractions.",

So I'm new to this idea, consider me a newbie cause I haven't quite mastered this techniqu yet.  \n\nSo in a lot of the posts in this sub, I read that people use music to get these spiritual chills voluntarily. I wonder, if the music which is such a beautiful form of art, is the reason that we get these chills, just like how other beautiful things in the world gives us the chills.\nIs it possible to get these voluntary chills without the music? \n\nPlease forgive me, if it's a stupid question lol.",

          "content": "Part 3\n\nTrain the body, train the mind. Discipline plays a crucial role in meditation, concentration takes willpower and focus. I lacked a great deal of all of the above, and I am always looking to improve. What helped is setting a routine, accomplishing tasks in a routine produces positivity. I get up early, between 4-6 in the morning, after a few minutes to open my eyes I make my bed. Before I leave my room I workout. This way ensures that I actually do it. I keep a large cup of water in my room and fill it up every night before bed. I make sure not to neglect stretching, lately I\u2019ve been doing qigong morning routines from videos on YouTube, it works well.\n\nAfter stretching I begin my workout. It\u2019s nothing major, I turn on some workout music and do a couple sets with some weights, some pushups, and situps, flutter kicks, or something similar. I take care not to push myself to injury. Satisfied with my workout, I take a shower. I have a speaker for the shower so I continue to listen to music while in the shower. Depending on how I\u2019m feeling I might take the time to meditate on how best to proceed with the day or consider decisions that have to be made.\n\nThe reasoning behind this philosophy is two fold. One it garners discipline through creating and sticking to a routine, secondly it promotes synergy between the body and the mind, when these are functioning well I find the Spirit easier to connect with all parts of Being acting in harmony. I believe that inspirational phrases alone are not enough. For instance one could say \u201cI am wonderful\u201d \u201cI am at peace\u201d until one is blue in the face. It isn\u2019t outside the realm of possibility, however with solely the verbal affirmations, the probability is low. The line of thinking here is one of balance. I think tire pressure is a good analogy, if one tire is low the balance of the vehicle is off. In the same manner one whose mental health is great but their physical health is not, the body and mind will allocate more resource to resolving that balance.\n\nI think that those selfsame phrases are very helpful, it\u2019s a form of neurolinguistic programming, also known as NLP. The mind is powerful, and positive or negative, it grows in tandem with what it is fed.\n\nThere is not much more to be stated on the principles and merits of discipline as the effects have been well documented.",

          "content": "Part 2\n\nAgain it is my policy to fully disclose that there will be elements of this writing that are spiritual, political, and are perspectives viewed within the lens of my experience. It is intended as entertainment, nothing more. It is also my conviction to disclose the negative aspects alongside the positive, doing so allows for that wider perspective, allowing for better decision making and the key element in practicing wisdom. This is a viewpoint that is not readily accepted, as I find most flat out reject the principle, this isn\u2019t their fault per se, as fault is too harsh a word, they simply want to remain in their comfort.\n\nUsing mantras/affirmations such as \u2018everything is/will be fine\u2019 is great and all, but what is it that is so wrong, that one would need to repeat this mantra? Finding the root of what is causing discontentment should be the goal. Affirmations are great, but if one is halfhearted in their pursuit, one should expect halfhearted results. Understanding both the positive and negative facets and accepting them as part of one\u2019s Being is paramount. A great many avoid looking at themselves, providing a means to avoid responsibility, fostering dishonesty and breeding other negativity.\n\nI would like to speak to specifics. I previously went through steps I go through to strengthen my Chills, however there are specifics and context that are taken into consideration. To start with music selection, I stated that my music reflects my intent. It is my belief that one should choose uplifting songs, such as songs that make one want to sing and dance, something that grabs/speaks to the soul. Not only does this help one stay on positively polarized, if a song makes me react that way, it appears there is a high natural affinity for that specific vibration. If this is the case, I add it to the list. This could be why a lot of my songs have similar melodies. While one could choose to make selections that promote the negative side, and foster negativity, I believe there is potential to do harm to others and to themselves.\n\nThe first few songs were easy to identify, I do have my favorites. Many others were added to the list by listening to similar music and adding what I wanted. Even if the current song was not suitable for the current intent, it might be suitable for another intent in the future. I add it to a separate list and sort them out at a later time, focusing on gathering new music can get get away from me pretty fast.\n\nMy memory for song is very good. I\u2019m able to remember lyrics a few times after hearing and reading them. I combine the newly acquired songs into a playlist and then I play them from inside the playlist to ensure I get the same feeling.  \n\nIn regards to the specifics of comfort, posture is important. Keeping the spine straight, and not leaning to the side are the two biggest problems I have. In regards to breathing, breathing through the diaphragm is important as it naturally calms the body and allows deep and slow breaths. At times, I have to check to see if I\u2019m breathing correctly. A potential issue here is that one can not breathe automatically while focusing on the breath. Case in point, you are now breathing manually, in this case I bring my attention back to the music. Breathing through the diaphragm causes the body to enter a relaxed state, this is especially relevant to the Chills. I find that my muscles tense up easier because of the bioelectricty that causes the Chills. This is more difficult when the Chills are intense. In order for the chills to spread evenly, I must make sure my muscles, arms, and legs, are not tense, and if they are I relax them. If this is done while focusing on the chills, the chills themselves feel finer, less coarse. They spread out spread back out instantly giving off that euphoric feeling.\n\nFor the process of intent. Intent is probably the most important contextual aspect of the universe, does one act out of love, or not? While meditating one needs something to focus on, intent. For someone who can access the Chills, this energy solely by itself is more than enough to be that focal point.\n\nPreviously the example of increasing density and intensity was used. In this example I will use something more applicable to daily life.\n\nActualization. It is the act/process of bringing thoughtforms into existence from seemingly nothing. Stuff just doesn\u2019t come from nowhere, right? Short answer, no. Long answer still no. All creation comes from love, and this is why one needs to accept the Self. One can not love another if one can not love themselves. This is not to use self love in a hedonistic context, rather to radiate love to others. Positivity can be infectious, however if that positivity is born from falsity, it does not radiate love.  \n\nAll things are made of light. Realizing this is a difficult concept to grasp, it helped to visualize light for what it is, a source of energy. That energy coming from the Original Thought, (perhaps some might call that the \u201cBig Bang\u201d, or God creating Light on the first day) thus Light=Thought and Thoughtforms=Light, Light=All things, All Things=Love, resolving any paradox.\n\nThe colors, shapes, sizes and all things viewable through human eyes are light-wave reflections that we view on a spectrum and ascribe certain values to produce tangible measurements. The operation of light and building structures is such that light appears as magnetism or electromagnetism or fields. In the case of those with the Chills, we generate those fields, and as such, light.  \n\nObjects having shape and form is the result of each object having a field of energy that keeps everything together. With the ability to generate this light and the ability to influence magnetic or auric fields, healers might want to look here.\n\nActualization, for me, is a process. If I wanted to move into a new house, I would picture the whole process not just an image of the house, that would be more Law of Attraction then Actualization.  \n\nI\u2019d envision weather and how the sun felt on my skin and appreciate that it\u2019s not raining. I\u2019d hold that focus for a moment. I\u2019d see the grass and notice how green it is, I\u2019d look at the U-haul, and take in the details. I\u2019d glace at the side of the truck and see how the sun glints off the orange paint, and again be thankful for the beautiful weather. I\u2019d see my brother and I moving the furniture, noticing the screen door is held open by that little metal stopper. It\u2019s such a minor thing, yet it has such a large impact.  \n\nI\u2019d hear the dogs barking in the back yard, they just want to play. I\u2019d see that we\u2019re both wearing older clothes, I\u2019d envision them from head to toe. The tan boots, the blue jeans, he\u2019s donning a tan shirt, mine is black. I\u2019d picture us joking and carrying on, then taking a break and drinking some cool water. Finally I would envision getting in the truck, and heading to the new house. I\u2019d see the drive there, notice the sun is going down at this point, we made good time, we\u2019d stop at a gas station before we left town for snacks and drinks.  \n\nI\u2019d see us on the highway, think about the conversations we will have, once more thankful, there\u2019s no one else on the road. After which we arrive at the new place, walking in the door and taking in the initial view. It\u2019s dark out and we\u2019re both running on fumes, we still made good time, a half hour earlier than expected. We\u2019re both satisfied with that result. I\u2019d laugh, because as expected, we decide to unpack tomorrow. It\u2019s a good thing I prepared for that and brought unpacked bedding.\n\nThis is what I call a mindscape, as the name suggests it is a landscape created in your mind, this mindscape was made consciously through mental focus. This can also be achieved subconsciously by letting go of the controls, so to speak. It is in this manner I came into contact with the Spirit/Self.\n\nI find this is an excellent application for the Chills. I can use them for something, and have tangible results. All the above is a lot to try and produce at once, so I break the events up into smaller pieces and assemble the puzzle. Before I place the puzzle piece on the table I gather the energy from the Chills and channel them into each piece one at a time, infusing the intent with more and more energy.",

These are my personal experiences and they may not suit the framework for every, or any, individual. I would like to specify what this is not. It is not a manual. It is not an instructional. It is not spiritual doctrine. It is not medical advice. It is not a blueprint. A new discovery or changed insight may lay the groundwork for a fundamental shift in perception/perspective. Adding or removing links in the Logic Chain may alter one\u2019s understanding. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, stop. Do not allow me to become a stumbling block in your path. \n\nIt is a recalling and telling of my personal experience, nothing more. The intention behind this diatribe is to provide a clear context and concise verbiage as possible. Writing in this fashion lessens the amount of words written, minimizing assumptions. As such I may use antiquated terminologies, and also phrases like, antiquated terminologies, rarely write in shorthand or acronyms, use new or altered phrases. (See Logic Chain written as a proper noun above.) I will always attempt to write as grammatically correct as possible. Attempt. These are easy to see for myself since I am their Origin Point, they may not translate to another framework as readily, if something peaks your interest let us talk about it. Promotion of free flowing ideas and sharing knowledge is most desirable.\n                      Part One\n\nMeditation, it has increased the intensity and density of my Spiritual Chills. So what is meditation? Meditation is about being in the moment, as completely and as wholly as possible. That is all. The reasoning behind this is to access the Spirit, or the Self, Infinity, Universe, etc. This allows one to learn the mechanics to manipulate reality as it is perceived by a third density Being. Whatever else people will call it, when I reduce it down to its base elements, this is what I found. There are many resources on achieving this state. I have found practicing meditation led to seeking higher understanding, and finally coming to the conclusion that One is All and All is One. Every path is acceptable, every spiritual concept is correct, all paradoxes are resolved, there is only unity. All paths are the only path, resolving this paradox.  \n\nBefore I start a meditation I will stretch, or similar action to open the blood vessels and promote the speed and efficacy of blood flow. Then I rest for about thirty to sixty seconds, then bounce on my heals for a few seconds, this acts as a way to \u2018shake down\u2019 the leftover energy.\nComfort is the most important aspect of meditation, no comfort, no meditation. I set my environment as I want it, if I feel like I need to move that chair three and a half feet to the south, then I will respect that intuition. My mind/body/spirit knows what\u2019s coming and wants to help. It is during this time I set my intention. \n\nSome words about intention. Lying to oneself makes the whole process null, and it could be harmful. The first step to intent is via honesty. I found honesty through acceptance of the Self. The positive and the negative. That means all the pain, all the suffering, sorrow and anger. Everything. In Jungian psychology this figure is called the Shadow, the term Shadow Work may be familiar and it specifically refers to reconciling these issues. It is my take that this step is crucial to advancement. Think on this for a moment, if the Spirit/Self is a piece of you, it has witnessed all that pain and suffering along side you, imagine the suffering it has gone through with nobody to listen. One must understand the positive and the negative to gain the wider perspective, to obtain this perspective it is just as crucial to obtain the understanding of how the state of the world came to decline so it does not serve as a distraction or makes one doubt. Such a system can not function without belief.\nAfter doing a bit of this Shadow Work I came into contact with the Self. A separate Being yet the same, a shadow in the form of a man. A being that knows every part of me, knowing the deepest parts of my soul, and once I accepted this, the hard work started. Due to this interaction, I find it literally impossible to lie to myself. Changing gears back to intention. Setting intention is the third on the list, I ask myself \u201cIn this moment, what do I want?\u201d \u201cFor whom do I want it?\u201d, I usually think on this for a few minutes, making sure the desire is congruent throughout my whole Being. Once set I begin my session. \nI use a form of active meditation, I listen to music, everything from Bach to Tupac. I specifically choose music that reflects the intentions I set. The music itself serves to drown out all other stimuli. The most abundant stimuli is the first one noticed by the mind, and to which it will dedicate the most resource. In quieting this first, the other senses are passively reduced during this time.\nTo this end, I have made multiple playlists on Spotify. Collection of music and using a phone or such device would alleviate advertisements. The time between songs serves to check to make sure I\u2019m not tensed up, relaxing if needed, to check my breathing, and if needed, my intention. In short, to re-center myself. Right before the next song starts I take a breath and send the chills very slowly throughout my body. (This has to do with a qigong technique.)\nI make sure I\u2019m comfortable and start the music to match the set intention, ones that create the most powerful chills. I choose songs that I know so my attention stays on the music.\nConsciously I make sure to breathe through the diaphragm slowly in through the nose, out through the nose. (There are many forms of breathing techniques, this is the one I found flows the best.)\nI close my eyes.\nI begin listening to the music.\nI let my thoughts wander as they will, if it is a wandering thought, it gets dismissed. \nIf the thought is a question, I examine it and either find it a wandering thought, or something that needs to be reconciled. I show more gains by working through them, it\u2019s like removing a blockade.\nI sometimes need to consciously bring the thoughts back to the music.\n\nHere is where the application comes into play. If my intention was to increase the density and intensity of the chills, I focus an image that depicts strength. From there I visualize and focus my energy starting to gather in my back, I gather it as shape it into a ball and compress it as tightly as possible. Then I release it and it flows throughout my whole body.\nAt this time I am lost in the music, I feel the soul of it. (All is one) that energy the artist passionately offers comes pouring into me. It\u2019s almost as if I am turning on the tap.\nThis energy is gathered in with the previous generated energy and compressed and released again. I continue this until I am satisfied or can no longer concentrate. I learned to not force myself back into it as it cheapens the experience. Instead I remain where I am for a few minutes to reflect and appreciate that experience. I feel rested and recharged, and I feel a deep sense of contentment and peace within. I feel loved.\n\nEDIT: Major formatting issues.",

I usually use this method to start gathering as much energy as possible to focus into whatever I'm working on at that moment. \n\nSince I've been consciously working on this for a while now, and can say with confidence that the energy now feels like it has weight to it, there is an undeniable density that was not there prior.

I remember when I first started smoking pot I used to feel a pull at this exact same spot.

I'm thinking, mmm, do I still have a doorbell? Because it was the sound of an ancient one I don't have anymore since like 15 years. Anyway, I want to check the time on my phone because it's night and I was sleeping. But when I push on the button to turn on the screen, it just turn one for a split second and turn off directly, without me having the time to read anything, so, I try again, same thing. I'm thinking maybe there's some forces blocking my phone or something. Then I look at my bedroom window. And, WTF, I see a very bright and intense white light (I have chill right now writing it), and, I start feeling a very strong energy in my body, like something electric all around my spine and all inside and around my body. I was thinking a lot of things very fast at that point, like since I saw the light I was like, \"so it is real, it's really happening now\" (I was thinking it was some kind of aliens at that moment) and then I became to be quite scared and I wanted it to stop. Then, I woke up, in the exact same position, but the energy was gone and the white light also. \n\nAfter that, when woken up, I would still feel some chills in my body when thinking about it. Also I felt a strong erection for a few second that started without any reason when I was wondering, wtf was that?\n\nAnyway, I just don't know or understand what it was and why I experienced that. Somehow I regret a little bit being scared and woking up, I don't know and wonder what would have happened if I didn't ask it to stop and if it lasted longer?\n\nHas anyone experienced that also? \n\nI precise, I'm really new to this, I never have meditated and I don't know anything about spirituality or whatever it could be. I just also experience a lot of synchronicities in my life, and I've experienced also precognition, especially a few days ago I had a vision in hypnagogic state that happened the next day. Anyway, just needed to talk about it. Because this is really weird. Thanks for taking the time to read me.",

Thank you for blessing me with so many of your children who have begun to understand your nature.

To take it not as a surface sensation, but deep wringing, resonating the song of our soul calling back to you in harmony. The myriad pattern of the back of your head, pulling us ever deeper in spirals and patterns, in connections of meaning too profound for words, makes us ache to see your face, though we know it would rend our very souls from inside us into you. A soul with which will throw this body like a rag to serve love. Thank you that you would gift me such will, and such love. Let my life reflect my heart, and my heart reflect you. I love myself, I love you. Thank you for sharing that love. It turns like a spindle, and burns like holy fire. I know that I can walk in that fire unharmed. It is my home. That you would give me grace, and all that you require is that I give it as well, letting holy fire to feel as refreshing as clear water. I am your child. I am that I am. The self sufficient creation. Our finite realm that began and will end, a thin sheet of paper to you. What are we to such a being? We are his bride. And we are of filth. But we are destined to return as his children. And we will be his bride. And the promise he gives your ego is that you get to keep you, in your pocket. Your human self. Will sit, unchanged, in the pocket of your God self. That is how much he loves you. Not one tear lost. Neither one smile. And if it was only for just you, he would have made all of creation all over again. You are even now outside of time smiling at yourself. You are already his bride. And the more you feel he truth of it the more your words echo along side his at the birth of this world, and more to come, for such a beautiful bride. The flower of the love you shared blooms exquisite in eternity. And what a bouquet we all make together. I am excited to see what we become when we grow up.",

It has been said that [God is love](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/z4vc97/god_loves_you_unconditionally/).\n\nIt seems to me that love is a powerful generator of spiritual chills.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqZrKn39\\_Ew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqZrKn39_Ew)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9TgwYZYqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9TgwYZYqk)\n\nThese are two videos from the Naruto anime, about how the girl Hinata loves Naruto. Pay close attention to how fondly she speaks to Naruto, how she is always thinking about him. When I watch this scene, I get profound spiritual chills. Later that day, I lay on the bed for my meditation session. I replayed this scene in my mind, combining that with [my meditation practice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/yrrv4d/a_practice_similar_to_spiritual_chills_generating/). Even though I am a man, I replayed the scene in my mind from Hinata's point of view, how the expressed her deep love for Naruto. And I felt all the emotions that she felt. And I felt like that love boosted my spiritual chills meditation. I instantly felt the warmth the energy all over my body. Whereas normally it would take me quite a while to build up my energy starting from the extremities going up, when I visualized Hinata's love for Naruto, I could feel the warmth in the entire body almost immediately, and it was emanating from the heart.\n\nI am a spiritualist, and in some of my research I have encountered the phenomenon of sleep paralysis. This is apparently [a precursor to astral projection](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/14vjpz4/the_connection_between_sleep_paralysis_and_astral/). This is when the soul gains awareness of the astral plane, but has not exited the body yet. The body cannot move because the awareness is transferred to the astral body of the soul in the astral plane. This is a set of observations which comes from r/AstralProjection.\n\nAnyways, sometimes people encounter negative entities during sleep paralysis and astral projection. These entities feed on low frequency emotions such as hate, fear, and lust. However when the person brings forth the emotion of love, the entity flees. Detrimental entities, which look like r/shadowpeople, cannot stand high frequency emotions. They  disintegrate under high vibrations. So love is able to generate high vibrations, and dispel evil spirits.",

It's mainly all about the breathing technique. I also just started watching the anime Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and was surprised that they talk about this very openly and most people probably think it's just some made up crap. I've read about how yogi meditators who focus on this all day will ascend to a higher dimension in around 30 something years if the dedication is that intense, and they supposedly have a history of 'rainbow body' ascensions numbering in the thousands going back thousands of years.\n\nFinal thought: within the last couple of years or so i had the intuitive thought to practice this energy raising and mindful positive meditation/projection into the world for the betterment of humanity (when i can remember) at 11:11...like a lot of people, I've received MANY 11:11 communications and I figure it's got to be a great time for a lot of us to synchronize our efforts to have a bigger impact instead of individually....so if you can remember, if you see that 11:11, give yourself a charge and think happy thoughts about the world becoming a better place immediately (ask for truth to be exposed, love, harmony, understanding, peace, forgiveness, etc.)",

          "score": 63,
          "author": "ConstProgrammer",
          "content": "Hello everyone. I have casually invented or stumbled upon a method how to consciously raise my vibration. It's not quite spiritual *chills* or \"goosebumps\" per say, but I think that it's very similar. This is somewhat related discipline, so I am writing about it here.\n\nVibrations usually do not come by themselves unless you have trained yourself to the point that it is automatic. You should not just lie there without moving. It takes some amount of effort.\n\nRaising vibration is a controlled process which requires discipline and concentration. They key factor in this is the will. You just think or imagine that some part of your body, such as the palms of your hands, are raising in vibration. You feel like you are warming your hands over a fire, yes. You feel the heat being generated in that body part that you determined to focus on. It feels like a warmness, or a numbness, or tingling sensation, which turns into a noticeable vibration, a pulsating sensation of energy flowing through.\n\nLet's try to raise vibration on the hand. Hold your hand out and imagine that you are warming it over the fire, or that you are holding an energy ball, or that electricity is flowing through your hand. Focus and concentrate, and even close your eyes if it helps you do this, visualize your hand glowing red hot like a rod of hot metal. You can visualize electricity, or flame, or heat coming out of your hand. It doesn't matter, what matters is that you first pretend that you feel an energy pulsating through your hand, and then you start to feel it for real. Eventually you get to a stage that if you ask someone to touch your hand while you are concentrating on it, they would say that your hand feels hot.\n\nIt may take up to an hour at first, just to be able to raise the vibration in your hand only, up to the point that you can objectively feel it as a real phenomenon. Now the next steps is to be able to do this exercise faster and stronger, directly on command, just in a snap. After you can conjure the vibration on your hand, time to do it on the other hand, and on the feet as well. Once you can do that, then you spread this energy, you spread the vibrations up and up, all over the body. Imagine that the energy is flowing up from the hands and feet like a river. Go slowly and make sure you cover every inch of your body, first up to the wrists/ankles, then to the elbows/knees, then to the shoulders/hips, then up and down the spine, then up to the back of the head, and over the top of the head into the third eye. After practicing that many times you will be able to raise the vibrations throughout your entire body, starting from the extremities and going up until the entire body is covered with vibrations.\n\nOnce you can get your body vibrating at will, this step is a precursor to full astral projection. You may not feel the presence of the body anymore, just your self and the vibrations, and you can go into the astral projection. You can also use similar technique to make certain parts of your body go numb, to \"turn off\" nerves in that body part, and not feel any pain if you have some. I had dental work done without anesthesia by just making my teeth and gums go numb, \"turning off\" the nerves in my mouth area.\n\nThis exercise can be done at any time of the day, just it requires discipline, concentration, and self control, and self attention. You need to be attentive to your self, to the feelings and energies of your body. Constantly give commands to your left hand for instance, repeat affirmations, \"I feel my hand glowing hot\". If the feeling subsides gradually, you repeat again and again. You need to constantly keep it up, just like you need to keep pedaling the bicycle otherwise you fall over. It only takes a little bit of mental effort to do it throughout the day. It's like a muscle that you keep training. You can do it while working at the computer, while eating, while talking, while walking around. There is no excuse for not keeping it up. For full body vibrations I have only tried to do it while idle, but I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to get a full body vibration while walking for instance. It is just very hard to get a full body vibration while idle even, and not all times I am successful with it.\n\nI have used this method to induce an astral projection experience, which you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/rpxqx8/wolf_saw_me_during_astral_projection/).\n\n>I couldn't sleep one night. I had been in bed for multiple hours, and then I decided to do astral projection. I lay flat on my back, completely relaxed. I imagine a warmth starting at the palms of my hands and soles of my feet. I imagine that I am warming my hands over a fire. After some amount of time this imagination becomes a real sensation that cannot be dismissed. I actually feel the heat being generated on my hands and feet. It feels like a pulsating or a vibration. Whenever I do this I ask my dad to feel my hand and he says that it is actually hot to the touch, so I'm not making this up. I just think about it, and I feel this heat or energy or vibration spreading throughout the body, first starting from the extremities, then going up and up until the entire limb feels pulsating with heat. It's more like a vibration at this point. So by now my legs are vibrating like a tuning fork. Then the vibration goes up and up until it reaches the back of my head. I try to cover the whole entire body with this heat vibration sensation. Eventualy I reach a point when I no longer feel the body there any more, it's just my \"self\" and the vibrations. I no longer feel the bed, and it's like I'm floating in space, and I feel myself rather \"small\". After that I do not remember what happened, it's as if I fell asleep....  \n>  \n>The next thing I remember, is I get out of my body, and immediately I float up, and I get out of the house phasing through the closed glass window.\n\nSo there is some kind of connection with astral projection, or this method can be used to induce an out of body experience. It's actually a kind of meditation. Creating warmth or vibrations in my extremities is indeed the only thing I do when I meditate.",

This is my first time posting in here and I am hoping to seek some guidance as I've been facing some blockage in my path. Lately I've been unable to summon my chills at will or even by completely focusing my awareness towards my spine and neck, given that previously I would summon my chills just by giving it a thought. But now it feels like it's all gone and it's quite frustrating honestly. I've been facing this issue for about 2 weeks now and it has brought down my quality of life overall. I am now unable to uplift my mood by randomly summoning my chills at any time of the day like I used to. It has got me worried that this change is permanent and  I have lost my control over my chills. Also an important thing to mention is that I have been an active weed smoker for about 1.5 years and I went cold turkey about 20-25 days ago. I don't know what relation it has with my chills (if it has any). Other than that, no major lifestyle change has taken place in my life. I am still able to concentrate my prana to my heart when I focus but then again, almost everyone I know can do that. I really wish you people to shed some light upon it. Has something like this ever occurred to you, when you've lost control over your ability to summon chills for a few days? Or am I doomed? Thankyou so much for reading.",

I don't remember why.  but now I'm 19 and I can cause vibrations all through my back and legs up to my head where theu get so intense my body starts to physically vibrate, it feels as if I am squeezing an imaginary muscle in my body to make them start.  I can start them in my head, neck, upper chest, groin area, or if I focus really hard in my hand I can start them in my back.  Now I've gotten to the vibrational stage in astral projection many times and those vibrations feel very different, so they are not the same.  I've heard I'm squeezing the \"tectonic?\" muscles in my back but I have no way to prove nor disprove it.  I've heard it's kundalini, however no one has ever given me any insight to kundalini and its difficult to get a straight answer on what exactly it is or feels like, so I am unsure.  now I have found here which sounds pretty close however I am not thinking or wishing for goosebumps, I am litterally squeezing an imagery muscle in my back to make my entire body vibrate.  If you've read this far thank you, if there are any insights, book, videos or anything what so ever please let me know so I can look into it.",

My phone has a very flimsy SD card holder which also houses the SIM card.\n\nThe moment I opened the housing, the SIM card flew right out.  Since it was late and my SO was deep in sleep, I decided to look for it the next day.\n\nThe following day I let my SO know what happened and we started looking for the SIM card to no avail. We cleared everything off of the bed and even moved it to check under it. Nothing, Nada, Zilch!  \n\nLogically it has to be somewhere. My SO checked near the walls and all around the bed, nothing. \n\nI almost resigned myself until the following thought crossed my mind... what if I just ask my guides or spirits to help me find it?\n\nI stood at the foot of the bed facing away from it and asked, \"Hey, if you can hear me can you help me find it?\"\n\nAt that same moment I felt chills come down the top of my head and felt it move towards the right side of my head.  I skeptically turned right and asked again, and felt the same chills move to the right again.\n\nAt this point I'm now facing the bed and I asked again. To my surprise I felt the chills move to the center-left side of my head which would leave me at an angle, facing towards the corner of the bed.\n\nOkay, I thought, moment of truth. I skeptically began moving the bed again to get a good reach into the corner. I shined my phones flashlight into the corner and to my surprise, there it was! My SIM card was faced down making it blend into the carpeting.\n\nI am pleased to say that whatever that was managed to help me find it. \ud83d\ude4f \n\nI'm now curious as to how to start developing it. Funny enough it never crossed my mind to try and use these chills as a Marco Polo tool of sorts until now.\n\nAnyone have any similar experiences or tips on how to further develop it?

I quite often experience these chills you are talking about, but its normally when I am experiencing an outside energy. But some nights when I am going to bed, a feeling goes into my shoulders that can sometimes last for hours.\n\nIt grows into that feeling you get just before a shiver, but there is no release like what comes with that shiver. It starts feeling like there is a build-up of energy or something and the only relief is when I twitch my shoulders, and that only lasts for a few seconds.",

However, due to circumstances beyond our control, in this life, we are not able to talk on a regular basis anymore. Many times over the years we will inherently \u201cknow\u201d what the other is thinking or feeling. Over the past few weeks this connection has become more intense, to the point where I was in that sleep state of drifting off and kind of half in and half out and I could feel this person embracing me and we had an entire conversation. \n\nIt feels like there is a reason for this increase in spiritual connection and I have been getting blips of the spiritual chills, usually from the left side of my chest down the rest of my body and ringing in my left ear multiple times a day and I know it\u2019s related to this person. \n\nI guess my question is, does anyone have any insight as to why there is an increase in this intensity? We are both in other relationships and I don\u2019t feel this is a romantic reasoning. But, whenever I feel them, it\u2019s like everything becomes peaceful and like I\u2019m finally \u201chome\u201d, in that because there is lack of communication there always tends to be a sense of longing or grief as well. \n\nI get these strange blips like zaps in my head that I can\u2019t describe. I always know it\u2019s this person. Sometimes I will smell their \u201cscent\u201d or cologne and we are miles apart. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m going crazy or like I\u2019m creating an obsession, but it always comes on without warning as I go about my day. \n\nAnyway, any thoughts and or advice would be appreciated as I navigate the new intensity. \n\nMuch love and light to all of you in your journey \ud83d\udc96",

          "content": " \\-The pleasurable \u201cchills\u201d or \u201cgoosebumps\u201d (aka frisson) experienced when listening to music, watching movies, viewing art, dancing etc. is a sensation that is sustainable for long periods and increases in intensity with dedication. It is the sensation needed to enter altered states of consciousness known as the Jhanas as well as to self-induce out of body experiences from a meditative state (visualization techniques are also required for OBEs).\n\n\\-During meditation, the peak intensity of the sensation is often called the \"rapture.\" It can become so intense it is uncomfortable. Reaching this peak requires profoundly lowering our heart rate and sustaining it. This eliminates the bifurcation echo down aorta that comes with each heart beat \"so that the sound of the heart beat can move synchronously up and down the circulatory system in harmonious resonance approximately 7 times a second.\" - See article below.\n\n\\-If you pursue this sensation within yourself by attempting to feel it as much as possible (all day, every day if you are able), it builds in strength significantly over time to the point where it becomes a full body sensation with the pinnacle being at the crown of the skull. You must become your own experiment as each individual\u2019s set of beliefs and emotional reactions are unique.\n\n\\-One fundamental key to the sensation is to achieve states of genuine, positive emotions such as love, gratitude, inspiration, courage, joy, unity etc. Therefore, anything that enables you to feel these emotions will work. Conversely, anything that prevents these, will prevent your sensation. Control of thought is the key.\n\n\\-It is important to take a non-judgmental perspective of all things, including yourself, in order to cultivate acceptance and love within yourself. Try to be honest with yourself at all times. Trust your feelings and intuitions.\n\n\\-Be patient and be understanding of yourself if you think you are struggling. This is a progression and it will take some time to strengthen, especially while first beginning to induce in meditation, as your brain reforms its pathways via neuroplasticity (weeks to many months depending on effort). Love yourself unconditionally for the greatest success.\n\n\\-Your sensation will inevitably grow in strength with persistence and you will begin to feel it more easily to a broader range of stimuli. You will eventually realize it is not the stimuli at all, but only your emotional state and control of your mind/thoughts that matter.\n\n\\-It is this same sensation that monks attempt to achieve during meditation and chanting. The chants or mantras are to create vibrations in the chest which can help stimulate the sensation as well as to keep one\u2019s focus single pointed.\n\n\\-It is the same sensation that \u201cspirit runners\u201d or indigenous long-distance runners attempt to achieve. Also called \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d in the west.\n\n\\-The current scientific term for the sensation is \u201cFrisson\u201d and it remains relatively unexplained in the public sector being reduced simply to a release of endorphins.\n\n\\-Other names include: Chakra Energy, Kundalini, Prana, Mana, Qi, Chi, Holy Spirit, life force, vibration among others depending on your cultural lens.\n\n\\-In the CIA analysis of the Gateway Process for consciousness it is described as \u201ca self-stimulation of the pleasure centers in the brain caused by the circulation of a \u2018current\u2019 along the sensory cortex.\u201d [https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf)\n\n\\-Remember this sensation is sustainable and will increase in intensity.

It\u2019s a daily thing. Every time I walk outside I sneeze. Let me know if you experience the same thing! \n\nApparently, sun sneezes are a genetic trait that is linked to a deviated naval septum. There is a bundle of nerves that connect your nasal cavity and optical nerves to your brain. When exposed to light, these nerves get stimulated causing you to sneeze. What I\u2019ve found is that my chills activate in my brain seconds before I sneeze. I can actually \u201ceat\u201d the sensation if I choose to release my chills inside my brain. If I hold back the chills, I sneeze. I\u2019d assume the energy accumulated by absorbing the sunlight in my eyes can be correlated with my chills I experience.

          "author": "Ok-Onion-3654",
          "content": "I have been feeling frissons for almost 9 years now. I feel it nearly everyday and it has become part of me. I've learned a lot and want to share how I trigger my frissons. (I call this ability frissons. It just sits with me better. Spiritual chills is basically the same thing.) \n\nYou'll notice that a lot of people post about how they \"think\" about frissons or recall a memory and suddenly they feel frissons. What's common is that everybody is seeing something in there mind prior to feeling frissons. I would say what you are seeing in your mind is referred to as your third eye. This is one of the chakras and a major source of where our frissons come from. By seeing something epic and awe inspiring you can trigger frissons. There are different ways to trigger frissons but I choose to use my third eye. Maybe by thinking of a loved one, or exploring my imagination. When listening to music, I'll let my imagination run wild. A trick I've found is to visualize seeing your favorite musician sing the words into a mic. Or visualize them playing a instrument. Listening to music and using your third eye at the same time work out great because you are using the physical (ears) and psychological (mind) to trigger frissons. With my own experience, i think frissons are 80% psychological and 20% physical. The third eye chakra is one of the easiest ways to trigger frissons once you know the key influence. The key is that your third eye is linked to your emotions and without any emotion linked to what it is you see in your mind, you will not feel frissons. I call these sights I see in my mind primers because they prime my mind to feel frissons. To sum it up. By exploring my mind, letting go of my emotions, and letting my imagination run free, I am able to trigger my frissons through my third eye.",

          "content": "I just woke up from a bad dream and I am having waves of chills. \n\nI have been getting chills a lot lately and they have nothing to do with being cold. I started having them about five years ago when I would have nightmares about being attacked by a person in my dream that had an \u201cevil\u201d presence to them. They would seem normal at first, but as they came closer I would start to feel unsettled. At some point in the dream, they approach me with a smile that sent chills in my body, and I could usually see sharp teeth, and they would have this look in their eyes that I could only describe as evil. After waking up, I would have chills that could last for up to 20 minutes. It felt as if there was an evil presence in the room with me, or maybe like a ghost presence that I could feel. Just for clarification, I am not a religious person and have never believed in evil they way it was described to me growing up.\n\nWithin the last year, I decided to start developing a spiritual practice that mainly involved seeing if I could learn to communicate with a spirit helper. It started off a just a curiosity to see if anything would happen. As I started doing meditation, guided imagery, and asking questions about spiritual matters, I would get these chills on a regular basis. At first they freaked me out because I always associated them with my bad dreams. I decided to explore them to see if maybe they were a way I was receiving a message. They have felt like there was a presence in the room, and I have tried to approach them and listen to them without being afraid. There have been times the chills came when I was doing something that felt good, and I began to believe they were a positive sign from either my mind or a spiritual energy. Coming from a place of no spiritual practice, they still kind of freak me out.\n\nWell, tonight I had an awful dream of a house at night that I had never seen.. It\u2019s somewhat hard to explain but there was a hole in the floor that was pretty large to begin with, but was bigger underneath then I could see. Sticking out of this hole was a large living object that was evil, or at least very twisted and dangerous. I knew not to get too close as it could somehow impact me if I came too near it, but I was not sure in what way.. It was a long living object that looked like a twisted mass of flesh and other living material. It was stationary mostly but could also move. At least one point on it looked like it had a twisted form of a human face and that there were more faces underneath that I could not see. In the dream there was something that happened with someone that got too close, and it has either sucked them down, or changed them in some way. And the striking thing about it is that I have had chills since I woke up, and picturing this creature even now gives me more chills as I write this. \n\nThis is quite disheartening because this makes me question whether the chills I feel is not a good thing and I need to stop. Or is it something I need to get closer to and it only takes this form because I am afraid or resisting it (aka Jacobs Ladder)? It has now been two hours of off and on chills, and any meditation, guided imagery of protection, (and even first attempts at prayer) just lead to more chills. What is going on?",

I felt...\"elsewhere\".\n\nI consider that experience like the opening of a window into the \"spiritual realm/s.

I could concentrate for only a song at a time but as I practiced more, I could maintain the sensation for longer periods of time. I can shift it from one part of my body to another and can will it without music now (though music helps). I primarily use emotion and often dance and contort in my mind to help keep the feeling going. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like taking off a hood or veil from your head. It\u2019s very instinctual for me now. The only downside is that if I channel too much at a given time, I get headaches and a pain behind the nose, kind of like when you nose breathe cold air for too longer.

Then I saw my twin flame perfect female counterpart absolutely beautiful. The way I saw this was there is another mirror dimension where the divine goddess energy that lives in me is mainly from and vice versa.\n\nThen today i meditated this morning no real guiding just listening to the music and healing frequencies and I wasn't feeling the same level of bliss at all and could feel my ego involved there was energy there but it was neutral. Blanketed over me. This frustrated me as the last 2 days I felt such bliss and pure joy, so I thought my ego had got the better of me during this meditation and there was desire at play messing things up. \n\nSo I meditated again this evening did a guided reiki healing. I was instructed to picture my twin flame or absolute perfect woman I guess so I do and I'm doing this heart energy transfer my heart is vibing with all kinds of energy. My stomach goes completely light like a roller coaster I got all kinds of bodily feelings my legs feel like they're dissolving. I'm seeing the akashic records and what my ego sees I'm also seeing the divine goddess vibrant purple and the divine masculine also divine purple and the way ego views things. This is like projected infront of me like I'm in a theatre kinda hard to explain. Above me there is the blue and purple below me is green like a garden or golf course. Then everything starts closing in black from the right side and my head and body felt like I was gonna explode. I pulled myself back tried grounding took my headphone out and it felt like I was about to go deaf there was weird feelings and pressures all over and around me. Obviously it's left me kind of shaken because I can't find anyone with experience with anything like this. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice ? \n\nI feel like the only feelings I should be following are the bliss like ones. I don't know if I should even carry on meditating though",

She told me I was sensing the Holy Spirit.\n\nSkip ahead a year, different church, and as soon as the music started I was covered in pins and needles. It felt like something was trying to get in under my skin. It was the holy spirit, I was sure of it.\n\nI\u2019ve attended many churches, superchurches, and signs and wonders seminars with her since then and it\u2019s always the same. The minute they start building energy, I get visible pins and needles.

          "content": "I wanted to share this journal entry with folks that can understand the spiritual journey I have been going through.\n\n\n\n4-24-21\n\n\n\"As I have stated before in previous entries;  these past 5 months of my life I have been through a transformative spiritual journey.  I am only beginning to start seeing the outline of my spiritual existence.  An existence that I am starting to believe transcends the limitations of my physical existence in the body of time and space.  \n\nThe discipline of meditation and visualization when in a deep state of relaxation has begun to evolve the understanding that I have about myself and my place in the universe.  Once awoken from these trance-like states a lot of the concepts and ideas begin to slowly slip away as if my mind once awoken, is like a vessel that has been overfilled by water and the excess continues to overflow and pour back into a collective stream of understanding that lies just beneath the surface of my conscious mind.  But I have realized that there is a small time window from when I first awaken from the meditations where many of the concepts and perceptions of that understanding linger somewhat intact for a brief time before the distractions of my physical existence and my biology begin to bury that knowledge again deep within my subconscious.\n\nI have just awoken from one such exercise and I am attempting to capture the shape and outline of what I just experienced while I was in a lucid meditation.  The first thing I want to mention is that the physical existence of my body and mind while conscious is very limited and I believe that there are forces of energy both positive and negative.  Once awake the negative/evil energy of this universe begins going to work on my flesh nature.  Selfishness, greed, envy, jealousy, addictive cravings, all of these things circle around me throughout my day as a background sound beneath a world filled with the clutter and vibration of different energy.\n\nIt is starting to become a spiritual intuition of mine to point out to myself the times that I realize and sense the influence or presence of the energies around me.  It\u2019s becoming like a familiar voice that I can recognize more and more.  Some people in the recovery circles would call it the addict mind and other\u2019s might call it the temptations of Satan and Sin.  Whatever name is put to it,  I am becoming more sensitive to feeling and identifying the subtle touch of it\u2019s attempts to influence my life.\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum,  I can also feel different emotional energies sometimes that manifest themselves as joy, peace, love, kindness, gratitude, and other positive emotions.  I seem to be most sensitive to these manifestations during and after a deep meditation.  Once awoken,  if I do not continue to focus my mind and will towards attracting positive energy into my life and expand the natural energy center\u2019s within my own body to better attune myself to these vibrations, they will begin to fade away into the background of chaotic noise and clutter of the world around me.  Many people speak of this in various circles as the law of attraction. \n\nThe perception of my spiritual framework is very similar to those that follow a line parallel to the Law of Attraction.  Alongside with my curiosity for Physical Energy in the scientific sense,   I believe that we carry our own emotional field around us that most people never realize or care to understand.  The phenomenon in Physics like the double slit theory or the Water meditation experiments show that our brain and emotional waves are forms of energy that interact and even change the matter and energy around us on a quantum level.  I believe like many others that the essence of our spirit/soul are forms of energy that carry within it the fiber of our being and existence.  This is existence is one that is veiled while we are awake throughout our day and limited by the 5 dimensions of our physical existence.  Energy in a scientific sense has shown that it is neither created or dies, merely changes forms.  Energy and mass are the same things in different forms with a catalyst of light and vibrational frequency, this is the heart of Einsteins (E=MCSqared) Energy = Matter X the Speed of Light Squared.\n\nMy spiritual faith and beliefs are somewhat intertwined with the little understanding that I have of Quantum Physics and Energy Polarity paradoxes.   Even now I can feel the shape of my perception during my meditation begin to fade away but I am going to try to write down as much of my theories down while I can still recall them.\n\nIt comes down to the focusing of our energy waves through thought and emotion to attract or manifest the physical existence (or perception of that existence) into our lives through the discipline of spiritual attune to various vibrational frequencies that exist around us.   I think that is actually a type and shadow of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in the Addiction Treatment world.  You control your thoughts which in turn feed your emotions which in turn change the way you behave and react based on the perception of your existence and your life.\n\nIn addition to this upon meditating about this concept in line with the Universe and my Spirituality.  My belief is once again supported by many scientists in the field of Physics;  The universe is infinite, there are many dimensions to our universe to which we have no real comprehension or understanding of because we are limited to the physicality of Time and Space within 3 spatial dimensions of Up and down, Forward and backward, and then Time and Space. \n \nMany Scientific studies have been done in the field of theoretical physics and there is a general consensus that there are at least 11 different dimensions in our universe.  Once we start getting into the higher dimensional planes, the concept of infinity is more important to theorize.  I believe that a certain level, all possibilities and all realities exist.  Any given potential for different outcome is already existing outside of space and time in the infinite variations of creation throughout the universe.  This follows the same school of thought as many Parallel and Multi Universe theories.   What is to say that we do not have an existence on a spiritual plane at a higher dimension that animates our own physical existence on earth but we have no full understanding of that existence because of those limitations.  This would explain many Near Death Experiences and other Out of Body experiences as well.\n\n\nWe have no idea what existence past our own dimensional experience is like.  How would we even begin to understand an infinite consciousness that is outside of time and space?  I believe that we exist physically but we also exist beyond those dimensions within our spiritual form but the human brain is limited in it\u2019s capacity to process our perception outside of space and time.  This is why I believe we need to sleep and have REM sleep.  I believe that similar to meditation and trances,  while we are sleeping we are revitalizing our spiritual connection to the universe which is actually our real existence in it\u2019s truest form.\n\nI know that many of my beliefs are starting to look similar to a Holographic Universe or Matrix theory of existence but it is the only thing that makes any small fraction of sense to the experiences and deeper intuitive instincts I have had all of my life.  I think my sensitivity to emotional and spiritual energy is what led me into addiction in the first place.  Opiate addiction was the only way to calm the confusion and chaos of the emotions I was having because I did not understand my own relationship and sensitivity to other energies around me and how I was influenced by them.\n\nThe more I learn to focus my will and spiritual energy on the emotional waves of various different visualizations of my life and my future;  The closer I become to the perception and potential of those outcomes.  I believe this is because those outcomes and potentials already exist in the infinity of various different higher dimensions of the universe.  This probably makes no sense to most people but I am now beginning to have diluted explanations for some of the beliefs that I have because they are once again relegated to a shadow in the background of my mind.\n\nHopefully I will remember to journal after the next time I have some sort of epiphany while I am meditating.  \"",

That's because I believe we are raising our vibration tuning into that of love, you can have the big bang at the end of it, I don't know what would happen would you ascend the 3d would your consciousness be automatically whole with every dimensional self, would you become enlightened. Would your ego die and your higher ego evolve like a phoenix. One thing I think is when you can raise your vibration and chills high enough you will explode with love and it will be like the big bang. Something biblical will happen. \n\nThis is no easy feat though as I've done this before I vibrated straight into reincarnation because I was chasing my ego's desires. I had to learn though and now I know. It's self love I'm chasing its where my ego is able to sacrifice itself and die for the innocent part of me the inner child. Perhaps then I'll pop my souls universe meditation bubble or I'll just fall madly in love with everything and everyone and be in bliss.",
