          "content": "Hi. This is my first post. I am 41 years old. I'm having frisson/chills since 14-15 years old. It started with music. Now came to the point i can have it if i want without exterior stimulus(just with a thought , not strong as with music though). It  is intensity and frequency increased over time but strongest one came around 20 years ago. It went to the point something inside my head literally hit the top, i felt it phisically. I afraid and closed the music. It was always a big mystery for me. I'm skeptic about it's nature. Is it just the brain's dopamine release or something related to spirit. I was more on the brain's product camp several years ago as an atheist at that time. But after having many interesting mystic experience for all these years that i can't explain and after researching NDE and SDE phenomenon closely I am convinced that there is something more. I feel this chills like the star of earendil that i use on a difficult life path. Still don't know what i can do more for a spiritual journey also not so sure about if we have to do anything. It looks like just being kind and loving is the right way still so hard to do in this world though. ",
